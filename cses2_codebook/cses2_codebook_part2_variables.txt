         |
         | The first three digits are the numeric version of the country
         | codes created by the United Nations Statistics Division
         | ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations", revised
         | 13 February 2002).
         |
         | The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single country, for the same election.
         |
         | The fifth through eighth digits correspond to the election year
         | as specified in variable B1008.

         | NOTES: B1010
         |
         | These variables report the original ("raw") weights provided
         | with the respective deposited data files.
         |
         | Selected documentation from the election studies about their
         | weights is provided in the election study notes that accompany
         | these original weight variables (B1010).
         |
         | A. TYPES OF WEIGHTS AVAILABLE FOR USE
         |
         | Election studies are allowed to provide weights to CSES
         | in as many as three categories:
         |
         | 1. "Sample" weights include those intended to correct for
         |    unequal selection probabilities resulting from "booster"
         |    samples, oversampling of a particular population, procedures
         |    for selection within the household, as well as other
         |    features of the sample design.
         |
         | 2. "Demographic" weights adjust sample distributions of
         |    socio-demographic characteristics to more closely resemble
         |    the characteristics of the population.
         |
         | 3. "Political" weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         |    electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         |    official vote counts.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them.
         |
         | Analysts can choose to make use of this set of original weights
         | (B1010), make use of either set of derivative weights created by
         | CSES (B1012 or B1014), create their own weights, or supplement
         | the original weights. And of course, depending on the analysis,
         | analysts sometimes choose not to use weights at all.
         |
         | - The derivative "Polity Weight" (B1012) has been created so
         |   that for each weight (sample, demographic, political), each
         |   respondent within the election study has a mean weight of "1".
         |   If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         |   will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         |   approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         |   study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         |   individual weight for each respondent within an election
         |   study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         |   election study.
         |
         | - The derivative "Dataset Weight" (B1014) has been created so
         |   that each election study in the dataset will contribute
         |   equally to analyses of respondents, regardless of the number
         |   of interviews in each election study.
         |
         | B. ELECTION STUDIES WITH MORE THAN ONE WEIGHT
         |
         | Most election studies either provide a single weight in one
         | of the three categories (sample, demographic, political), or
         | they do not provide a weight at all. Twelve election studies,
         | however, provided weights for more than one category.

         | Seven election studies have provided a single weight that
         | is a combination of two or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political). For these election
         | studies, the weight is duplicated in the two or more appropriate
         | weight variables. Thus, analysts attempting to use two or more
         | categories of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication. There are duplicate weights in the CSES
         | Module 2 Full Release for these seven studies:
         |
         |   ... Brazil (2002): sample, demographic
         |   ... Germany (2002 Mail-Back): sample, demographic
         |   ... Germany (2002 Telephone): sample, demographic
         |   ... Great Britain (2005): sample, demographic
         |   ... Ireland (2002): sample, demographic
         |   ... Poland (2001): sample, demographic
         |   ... United States (2004): sample, demographic
         |
         | There were also five election studies that provided separate
         | weights in two or more categories (sample, demographic,
         | political):
         |
         |  ... Belgium (2003): demographic, political
         |  ... Mexico (2003): sample, demographic, political
         |  ... Netherlands (2002): demographic, political
         |  ... New Zealand (2002): sample, demographic, political
         |  ... Peru (2006): demographic, political
         |  ... Portugal (2005): demographic, political
         |
         | Sometimes weights build on each other. For example, a
         | demographic weight might take an existing sample weight and
         | supplement it with additional demographic corrections. Because
         | CSES does not create the original weight variables (rather, the
         | variables are provided by collaborators), we do not know
         | firsthand if the multiple weights for an election study are
         | independent, or if they build on each other. In the absence of
         | documentation from the collaborator, one piece of evidence that
         | can be used to guess at this is to look at the correlations
         | between the different weights. The correlations for the seven
         | aforementioned election studies are as follows:
         |
         |   ...  0.8544: New Zealand (2002): demographic-political
         |   ...  0.6827: New Zealand (2002): sample-demographic
         |   ...  0.5600: New Zealand (2002): sample-political
         |   ...  0.5575: Belgium (2003): demographic-political
         |   ...  0.3137: Netherlands (2002): demographic-political
         |   ...  0.1351: Mexico (2003): sample-political
         |   ... -0.0157: Portugal (2005): demographic-political
         |   ... -0.0091: Mexico (2003): sample-demographic
         |   ... -0.0051: Mexico (2003): demographic-political
         |   ... -0.0011: Peru (2006): demographic-political
         |
         | Pairs of weights with higher correlations are perhaps more
         | likely to be a situation where one weight builds on another,
         | or at least they share some of the same types of corrections.
         | As confirmation of the value of this test, we see in the
         | election study note for the New Zealand (2002) weights that
         | the weights in New Zealand are cumulative, which is hinted
         | at by the high correlations for New Zealand in the above list.
         | We also know from the Belgium (2003) election study note that
         | their political weight takes into account demographic
         | corrections as well. This is confirmed by the relatively high
         | correlation (0.5575) of the Belgian demographic and political
         | weights in the table above.
         |
         | C. OVERSAMPLES
         |
         | Analysts can use the election study notes for the weight
         | variables to identify design issues such as oversamples, which
         | are usually accounted for in the development of sample weights.
         | For example, we know from the election study weights that the
         | designs for these four studies intentionally oversample:
         |
         |   ... Canada (2004) oversamples the eight smaller provinces.
         |   ... Germany (2002 Telephone) and Germany (2002 Mail-Back)
         |       both oversample the East German population.
         |   ... New Zealand (2002) oversamples the Maori population.
         |
         | Typically a sample weight makes corrections to account for
         | any oversample and makes the election study representative
         | again of the general population. For countries with oversamples
         | that provide multiple weights (sample, demographic, political)
         | some hope to see that the demographic and political weights
         | are cumulative, carrying forward any oversample corrections
         | from the sample weight. In CSES Module 2, this seems to be the
         | case. Of the four aforementioned election studies, only the
         | Germany (2002 Telephone) and New Zealand election studies
         | provided multiple weights. We know that the New Zealand weights
         | (sample, demographic and political) are cumulative because
         | this is mentioned in the election study notes. This is
         | also supported by the high correlations between the New Zealand
         | weight variables. Both election studies from Germany provided a
         | single weight each that makes both sample and demographic
         | corrections, including an adjustment for the oversample of the
         | East German population.
         |
         | D. OTHER NOTES ABOUT THE WEIGHTS
         |
         | Analysts will want to keep in mind that the CSES weights are
         | prepared to be election study weights, not country weights.
         | To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is not available, these
         | variables are coded "1" for each respondent.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM (2003): B1010-B1014
         |
         | The demographic weight is based on the joint distribution of
         | region, age, gender, and education for the Belgian sample. The
         | political weight contains weighting coefficients for joint
         | distribution of region, age, gender, education and vote in the
         | 2003 General Elections for the Belgian sample. Since the sample
         | was drawn in such a way that every person had the same chance of
         | being selected, there is no need to compensate for differential
         | probability of selection, hence a sample weight is not provided.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2002): B1010_1 and B1010_2
         |
         | One original weight variable was submitted with the Brazilian
         | data file. It compensates for both disproportional sampling
         | in So Paulo, and the demographic profile of the population
         | of the country. Hence, this weight variable is included as
         | both B1010_1 (sample weight) and B1010_2 (demographic weight).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BULGARIA (2001): B1010-B1014
         |
         | The weights adjust the sample to data provided by the National
         | Statistical Institute by gender, age, ethnicity, type of
         | residence (e.g. capital city vs. city vs. town vs. village).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CANADA (2004): B1010_1
         |
         | This weight represents the original National Weight, constructed
         | as the product of the household weight and the provincial weight
         | and should be used with the National Sample when national
         | estimates are required. The household weight compensates for the
         | higher probability of households with smaller number of adults
         | to be included in the sample. Provincial weight compensates for
         | over representation of the eight smaller provinces and a
         | corresponding under representation reduction in Ontario and
         | Quebec. The weights are prepared for the entire Canadian
         | Election Study sample, i.e., not separately for the
         | post-election and mail-back data sets. The re-interview rates
         | are reasonably high and sample attrition between the surveys was
         | not associated with household size or province.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2005): B1010_2
         |
         | One original weight variable was submitted with the Chilean
         | data file. It is designed to match the distribution of sex and
         | education in the population and the results of the first round
         | of the presidential election.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2002): B1010_2
         |
         | There is one demographic weight designed to match the population
         | distribution of educational level and employment type (work in
         | public or private sector).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2002 Mail-Back): B1010-1014
         |
         | A single weight is provided which makes both sample and
         | demographic corrections (it has been duplicated under the
         | sample weight and the demographic weight). The weight corrects
         | for oversampling of the East German population and also includes
         | demographic corrections for gender, age groups, and education.
         | This weight MUST be used if Germany is analyzed as a whole.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2002 Telephone): B1010-B1014
         |
         | A single weight is provided which makes both sample and
         | demographic corrections (it has been duplicated under the
         | sample weight and the demographic weight). The weight corrects
         | for oversampling of the East German population and includes also
         | demographic corrections for gender, age groups, and education.
         | This weight MUST be used if Germany is analyzed as a whole. It
         | weights the demographics according to population weight,
         | resulting in 410 Easterners and 1590 Westerners.
         |
         | Analysts may notice that the ratio of the maximum weight
         | (7.3100) to the minimum weight (0.0100) for the Germany (2002
         | Telephone) study is quite large relative to other election
         | studies in the CSES dataset. The CSES Secretariat has confirmed
         | with the collaborators that this is intentional. Likewise,
         | analysis by the CSES Secretariat indicates that this is probably
         | ok. The weight is fairly evenly distributed over the range
         | 0.0100 to 7.3100. When we look with and without the weight
         | at the Germany (2002 Telephone) distributions for gender, age,
         | turnout in the current election, whether close to a party, and
         | political knowledge, the distributions change, but not
         | significantly. The weight changes education some, but not a
         | lot.
         |
         | While it does not appear in the CSES dataset, the collaborators
         | have available a weight that corrects for gender, age groups,
         | and education for East and West Germany separately. It weights
         | the demographics within each part (West and East) so that one
         | ends up with two "country" samples of roughly 1000. This weight
         | can be used if analysts wish to treat Germany as two
         | "countries". To obtain this weight, please contact the Germany
         | (2002 Telephone) study collaborators directly.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (2005): B1010_1-B1010_2
         |
         | The original sample weight adjusts for a) unequal selection
         | probability of respondents, b) non-response rates and c)
         | demographic features (gender, age and region). Selection weights
         | are equal to the inverse of the DU (dwelling units) and
         | respondent selection probabilities. The DU selection weight is
         | equivalent to the number of DUs at the selected address, for the
         | majority of cases this is equal to 1. The person weight is
         | equivalent to the number of eligible adults in the household.
         | The non-response weight is calculated as the inverse of the
         | predicted probabilities from a logistic regression model
         | estimated to predict whether or not the selected individual
         | responded. The last stage of the weighting process was to adjust
         | the final non-response weights so the weighted sample matches
         | the population in terms of age (population 18 years or older),
         | sex and region. The BSA data was weighted to adjust the marginal
         | age/sex and GOR distributions using raking-ratio (or rim)
         | weighting and using the 2004 mid-year, population estimates from
         | ONS/GROS. In each step, to correct for high and low weights, a
         | small number of extreme values were trimmed. Weight factor was
         | estimated considering the total sample of 4.268 individuals,
         | from which CSES is a random sub-sample (with 860 respondents).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HUNGARY (2002): B1010-B1014
         |
         | The Hungary 2002 demographic weight variable sets the size of
         | forty groups defined in terms of sex, age, place of residence
         | (urban vs. rural) and education equal in the sample to the joint
         | distribution of these four variables in the population estimates
         | provided by the Central Statistical Office for January 2001.
         |
         | The weight variable supplied with the Hungarian micro-data was
         | created using the following information: the number of cases in
         | the cells of two-way cross-tables of sex, a seven-category age
         | variable, a three-category education variable and an urban/rural
         | residence dummy variable in the 18+ year old Hungarian citizen
         | population as estimated by the Central Statistical Office (KSH)
         | of the Hungarian government for January 1, 2001; and the
         | respective frequencies from the Hungarian micro-data for the
         | CSES study.
         |
         | First, 40 demographic groups were defined by collapsing some of
         | the cells in a four-way cross-table of the above-mentioned
         | variables. The value of the weight variable deposited with the
         | CSES micro-data was calculated for all respondents as the ratio
         | between expected and observed relative size of their demographic
         | group. The expected size of each demographic group was
         | determined through an iterative algorithm that set marginal
         | constraints on the size of some more highly aggregated groups
         | given the information available from the available
         | KSH-estimates.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2002): B1010-B1014
         |
         | The weight is constructed using a minimum information loss
         | routine with marginal constraints based on age, gender,
         | Principal Economic Status, region, marital status, level of
         | educational attainment, and household size (the number of
         | persons aged 18 years and older).
         |
         | Because the PSUs were selected from the Electoral Register
         | larger households had a disproportionately higher probability of
         | selection than smaller households. This was addressed in the
         | re-weighting scheme by including a dimension on household size
         | (number of persons aged 18 years and over).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2006): B1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight adjusts the sample distribution based on
         | gender, level of education and geopolitical Cattaneo areas.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2004): B1010_1
         |
         | The original sample was selected with EPSEM design; therefore no
         | sample weights were created. However due to the disproportionate
         | attrition by PSU, the entry of a new sample in the latter wave
         | resulted in a non-EPSEM sample. Therefore, this difference in
         | selection probability is reflected as a sampling weight. It was
         | not attempted to match sample demographics with known population
         | estimates of the universe for the following reasons: (1) Often,
         | during the years between each census (e.g., 5 years), the
         | estimates from the population registry are used as the estimates
         | of the universe (this survey used both the population registry
         | and the voting registry as the sample frame). Therefore, the
         | sample frame used in this study is comparable to the population
         | frame; (2) Only a few studies examining coverage error of the
         | voting registry and population registry were conducted and they
         | were done in the 1970s, at which point, the coverage error was
         | minor. No other studies have been conducted since. Response
         | weights were made by means of propensity weighing adjustment,
         | using the information gathered in previous waves of the survey.
         | As there are multiple waves of surveys in the JESIII, the
         | dataset was first re-constructed into one record per wave format
         | (like that of survival data) and logistic model proved fit,
         | using response to each wave as a dependent variable and using
         | various measurements from previous waves as predictors. As a
         | result, the weighting did not try to correct/match distribution
         | of the sample to the known universe (i.e., census); rather, they
         | referred to the distribution of variables in previous waves. The
         | variables included in the propensity mode were: gender, age
         | group (in categories), college education as a dummy variable,
         | income as categorical variable, home ownership as a dummy
         | variable, employment status as a dummy variable, and summary
         | statistics of "don't know" responses.

         | Sampling units were selected with unequal probabilities. Weights
         | are estimated and used to correct for these unequal
         | probabilities. Poststratification weights were estimated to
         | correct for non-response and to match known demographic
         | characteristics of the population (gender and age, based on
         | census data from 2000).

         |
         | The sample weight corrects for oversampling of the Maori
         | population.
         |
         | The demographic weight incorporates the sample correction, and
         | adjusts for the gender and age distributions of the respondents.
         |
         | The political weight incorporates the sample and demographic
         | weights, and adjusts the distribution of votes cast and
         | non-voting.
         |
         | Note: these weights are cumulative.
         |
         | Analysts may notice that the ratio of the maximum demographic
         | weight (5.5111) to the minimum demographic weight (0.0278) for
         | the New Zealand (2002) study is quite large relative to other
         | election studies in the CSES dataset. The CSES Secretariat has
         | confirmed with the collaborators that this is intentional.
         | Likewise, analysis by the CSES Secretariat indicates that this
         | is probably ok. The demographic weight is fairly evenly
         | distributed over the range 0.0278 to 5.5111. When we look with
         | and without the weights at the New Zealand (2002) distributions
         | for gender, education, turnout in the current election, whether
         | close to a party, and political knowledge, the distributions
         | change, but not significantly. The weights change the age
         | distribution some, but not a lot.

         | distributions different from GUS data. Therefore the study
         | results were weighted by means of especially designed software,
         | which takes into account: differing selection probabilities,
         | related to the adopted sampling scheme (1 person per household
         | regardless of number of inhabitants); differential nonresponse

         | strata), age (3 strata), and education (3 strata).
         |
         | The demographic weight was originally deposited with 215 cases
         | having missing data. In the CSES data file, these cases are
         | coded "0."  These are cases for which at least one relevant
         | demographic variable was missing for the respondent. The
         | collaborator preferred to assign a weight of "0" to these cases

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - RUSSIA (2004): B1010-B1014
         |
         | The Russian team provided a sample weight which adjusts for
         | the use of the Kish procedure to select individuals within
         | each household.
         |
         | The issue is described in the Design Report for Russia (2004):
         |
         | "The Kish procedure selects one adult from all eligible of
         | eligible adults in each household. This means, for example, that
         | adults in a three-adult household have only one-third the
         | probability of selection of adults in a one-adult household. One
         | can adjust for this by using a weight based on the reciprocal of
         | the number of eligible adults."
         |
         | The Design Report also described the procedure used to create
         | the weight:
         |
         | "We have a variable for the number of adults who were eligible
         | to be interviewed in a household, from which one was chosen
         | using the Kish procedure. The variable is named ADULTS."
         |
         | "First, we made a preliminary run using SPSS in which we do not
         | use any weights. Runed frequencies for a variable for which
         | there is data for all respondents, like gender. This gave us
         | the total number of individual adult respondents (which of
         | course we already knew). The number of respondents (without
         | weighting) is 1648."
         |
         | "Next, we run the same frequencies using WEIGHT BY ADULTS.
         | This time, because of the weighting, the total number of
         | respondents on the frequencies output was 3395--which of course
         | was wrong. Weighting gave each respondent the proper relative
         | weight, but the total number of adults (the number of degrees
         | of freedom) would be too high. This would make the confidence
         | intervals seem smaller (more precise) than they should be."
         |
         | "Finally, we created a new permanent weight as follows:"
         |
         | "Final weight=(1648/3395)*ADULTS."
         |
         | "In other words,"
         |
         | "Final weight=(number before weighting/number after preliminary
         | run)*(adults)"
         |
         | "This will shrink the total number of cases back to the correct
         | number, but still give each person the proper relative weight
         | within the sample."
         |
         | Tables comparing the demographic attributes of the sample in
         | the post-election parliamentary survey with those from the
         | 2002 census are available in the Design Report. Weights that
         | adjust for demographic deviations from the census results are
         | described in the Design Report, but were not provided to CSES,
         | and thus do not appear in the data.

         | and was therefore conducted as a supplementary postal survey.
         | Percent total panel attrition: 31.8%. Seven groups of
         | respondents with significantly different probabilities to drop
         | out between telephone interview and supplementary postal survey
         | were identified using a segmentation algorithm (exhaustive chi

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2004): B1010-B1014
         |
         | The 2004 American National Election Study (ANES) consisted of
         | pre-election interviews of 1,212 respondents, and post-election
         | reinterviews of 1,066 of those respondents.
         |
         | The weight provided for CSES Module 2 is the 2004 ANES
         | post-election weight. The 2004 ANES post-election weight builds
         | on the 2004 ANES pre-election weight, and accounts for attrition
         | since the pre-election study.
         |
         | Because the 2004 ANES post-election weight is both a sample
         | weight and a demographic weight, it is duplicated in the CSES
         | Module 2 weights under both the sample weight and the
         | demographic weight.
         |
         | The 2004 ANES codebook describes the pre-election weight as
         | follows:
         |
         | "This is a 6-digit variable with coded decimal point and
         | 4 actual decimal places. The 2004 NES weights are
         | post-stratified to 2004 CPS March Supplement proportions for
         | six (6) ages by four (4) education categories. The
         | post-stratification adjustment is computed by dividing the CPS
         | weighted total by the 2004 NES total weighted by the nonresponse
         | adjusted selection weight. The final analysis weight is the
         | product of the household level non-response adjustment factor,
         | the number of eligible persons, and a person-level
         | post-stratification factor."
         |
         | The 2004 ANES codebook describes the post-election weight, the
         | weight which appears in the CSES Module 2 dataset, as follows:
         |
         | "The 1,066 Post-Election cases were post-stratified to 2004 CPS
         | March Supplement proportions for six (6) ages by four (4)
         | education categories. The post-stratification compensates for
         | differential non-response by age group and education level. The
         | panel attrition weight for the Post-Election Study is the
         | product of the Pre-Election final weight and the
         | post-stratification factor formed by dividing the CPS proportion
         | by the weighted NES proportion for each of the 24 age by
         | education cells. The weight is scaled to sum to the number of
         | cases, 1066."

         | on the basis of the samples appearing in the CSES data files
         | (i.e. does not incorporate booster samples, panel respondents
         | who did not participate in the CSES wave of multi-wave studies,

         | systems, as the unit of analysis. Analysts wishing to compare
         | across-countries, instead of across-election studies, should
         | adjust this weight accordingly.

         | The Slovenian study did not record the interviewer, but it
         | coded the PSU (primary sample unit) where the survey took place.
         | Given that almost all surveys from each PSU were conducted by a
         | single interviewer, the PSU variable can be used as a reasonable
         | proxy here. The collaborator described that: "There were 136
         | interviewers assigned to 136 PSUs. As a rule, each interviewer
         | had one PSU on duty. Cases of the remaining 4 PSUs were
         | distributed among some of the interviewers on a case-by-case
         | basis, so it is possible that more then two worked there.
         | This happened on a fraction of cases only (up to 5%)".

         | amount of time on the two jobs, it reports the job for which
         | the respondent earns the most money.
         | For respondents who are currently employed, this variable
         | reports their current occupation. For respondents who are

         | the socioeconomic status of the person who was the head of
         | family. Accordingly, the responses of all respondents that were
         | not the head of family are recoded with code five.

         | "These answers have been constructed out of 3 questions
         | coming from the Dutch Parliamentary Election Study. These
         | question are:
         | 1. 'Could you indicate what your partners daily activities
         | are or which situation applies to your partner?' 1) I am
         | currently employed, 2) I was employed but not anymore, and
         | 3) I have never been employed.
         | 2. How many hours does your partner work on average per
         | week, not counting unpaid hours?
         | 3. Your partner was employed, but are no longer. Is that
         | because of permanent disability or is your partner unfit
         | to work, unemployed or being job-seeking, retirement,
         | living off investments, housekeeping, care for children
         | or is there another reason?
         | In the Dutch case the reason why respondent never worked
         | hasn't been asked. These are all put in category 10,

         | (1) This variable reports the respondent's spouse's main
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's
         | spouse spends the most time. In cases where the respondent's
         | spouse holds two jobs, and spends an equal amount of time on
         | the two jobs, it reports the job for which the respondent's
         | spouse earns the most money.         
         | For spouses who are currently employed, this variable
         | reports their current occupation. For spouses who are retired
         | or not currently working, this variable reports the spouse's
         | last occupation.

B2027    >>> REGION OF RESIDENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         D27.  This variable reports the respondent's region of residence.
         Regions are usually (but not always) based upon the social,
         cultural, or historical differences (though some correspond to
         administrative regions) that manifest themselves in political
         cleavages.

         | original data set. According to the collaborator, "One of the

         | the vast array of names Brazilians come up with for their skin
         | color, in contrast to the rigid classifications schemes [...]."

         |
         | Some election studies used an earlier version of the CSES
         | questionnaire which included the words "BIG" and "ANY" in the
         | question text and response options.
         |
         | For example (for B3013):
         | "1. It makes a BIG difference who is in power"
         | "5. It doesn't make ANY difference who is in power"
         |
         | As a result, there has been variation in question wording and
         | response options for variables B3013 and B3014. The following
         | table documents how election studies asked these items. Please
         | reference this table as well as specific election study notes.
         |
         | If there is no variation in the question text and response
         | options, this is indicated with a "0". An "X" denotes a
         | variation in the question text and response options while
         | empty cells indicate that it was not possible to verify
         | the exact wording of the question text.

B3014    >>> WHO PEOPLE VOTE FOR MAKES A DIFFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Q10.  Some people say that no matter who people vote for, it won't
         make any difference to what happens. Others say that who people
         vote for can make a difference to what happens. Using the scale on
         this card, (where ONE means that voting won't make a difference to
         what happens and FIVE means that voting can make a difference),
         where would you place yourself?
         ..................................................................

         | NOTE: B3013 and B3014
         |
         | Some election studies used an earlier version of the CSES
         | questionnaire which included the words "BIG" and "ANY" in the
         | question text and response options.
         |
         | For example (for B3014):
         | "1. It makes A LOT of difference who is in power"
         | "5. It doesn't make ANY difference who is in power"
         |
         | As a result, there has been variation in question wording and
         | response options for variables B3013 and B3014. The following
         | table documents how election studies asked these items. Please
         | reference this table as well as specific election study notes.
         |
         | If there is no variation in the question text and response
         | options, this is indicated with a "0". An "X" denotes a
         | variation in the question text and response options while
         | empty cells indicate that it was not possible to verify
         | the exact wording of the question text.

         | Note: Because B3016 refers to participation in presidential

         | The question about participation in previous election (B3016) is

         | The LONG version of Q18 is appropriate for use in systems where
         | AT LEAST ONE party bloc (or electoral alliance) is formed. This
         | version of the party identification question prompts respondents
         | who identify with a party bloc to specify which party within the
         | party bloc or alliance they identify with most.
         |
         | The SHORT version of Q18 is used by polities where NO party
         | blocs (or electoral alliances) formed.

         |
         | The Q18 series (includes variables B3028-B3036) utilized skip
         | patterns whereby respondents were asked different questions
         | based on how they initially answered B3028. There are many skip
         | pattern inconsistencies. Additionally, this series of questions
         | was administered in different ways, across election studies.
         | Therefore, unless there were obvious coding errors, the data
         | remain unchanged.

         | Respondents that respond 'No' to B3028 are not asked the follow-
         | up variables B3029_1-B3029_3. However, due to some inconsistency
         | in the application of this question, there are two respondents
         | who responded 'No' in B3028 but also mentioned a party in the
         | B3029 series. The data remain unchanged.

         |
         | Party identification series of questions (B3028-B3026) was
         | asked in a non-standard way in the Czech survey. First
         | question B3028 was not used strictly as a filter for asking
         | the subsequent set of questions. Hence, there is a number of
         | skip-pattern inconsistencies (e/.g., there are some respondents
         | who did not select any party in party identification items, yet
         | were asked how close they feel to the selected party (question
         | B3036)). Some of the inconsistencies remain unchanged. Next,
         | respondents who chose more than one party were not asked to
         | select a single most preferred party (question B3033). Finally,
         | the three separate party identification variables (B3029_1,
         | B3033, and B3035) were submitted as a single variable. In
         | order to conform with the CSES standards, the CSES variable
         | B3035 includes only those respondents who did not answer "YES"
         | to B3028. CSES variable B3029_1 includes only those respondents
         | who answered "YES" to B3028. CSES variable B3033 was coded
         | "97. MISSING" since the questionnaire did not contain the
         | corresponding question.

         | In this mail-back survey, inconsistencies in the Q18 series of
         | questions (B3028 - B3036) indicate that a substantial number of
         | respondents did not follow the skip patterns for this set of
         | questions. Specifically, many respondents answered both "yes"
         | and "no, don't know, or refused" sets of follow-ups; therefore,
         | in these cases responses exist in both sets, even though only

         | This item was not asked in the Norwegian Election Study; rather,

         | "Many people think of themselves as adherents to
         | a particular party, while others feel no affiliation with any
         | party. Would you say that you in general think of yourself as a
         | Conservative, a Laborite, a SV supporter, etc., or don't you
         | consider yourself affiliated with any particular party?" If a
         | respondent identified a party, the case is coded "1. Yes" to
         | this item. If respondents reported "No such ties," they are
         | coded "2. No".

         | Among the political organizations available to respondents
         | in the party attachment battery (B3028 thru B3036) in
         | the Peruvian survey, there are both political parties and
         | political coalitions. However, the collaborator treated all
         | entities as political parties, and accordingly, applied the
         | short version of the party attachment battery. The reason for
         | this is due to the high level of political volatility of
         | political organizations in Peru. According to the collaborator:
         | "One of the main problems in Peruvian politics, is the high
         | level of party and electoral volatility. In fact, electoral
         | coalitions are defined not necessarily by the parties but by
         | the leaders and candidates. It is very difficult for common
         | citizens to distinguish particular members of an electoral
         | coalition. That's why we decided not to apply the follow up
         | questions". Accordingly, all mentions of political
         | organizations are treated as mentions of political parties.

         | the variable was separated in B3029_1, which included only

         | Due to a skip pattern inconsistency, all respondents were
         | asked Q18D (B3035). Because respondents who answered "yes"
         | to Q18 (B3028) should not have been asked Q18D, these cases
         | have been recoded into B3029_1. Therefore, if respondents

         | In the CSES Module 2 questionnaire, the request for
         | collaborators to ask respondents for left-right leader ratings
         | appeared only as a note within the questions for left-right
         | party ratings:
         |
         |   "Question to be asked of up to six 'relevant' parties. In
         |   presidential elections, question to be asked also of 'major'
         |   presidential candidates. (Candidates A through F should match
         |   parties A through F where appropriate.)"
         |
         | Understandably, many CSES collaborators did not notice this
         | note and thus either did not ask or did not deposit left-right
         | ratings for leaders. The result is that left-right ratings for
         | leaders are only available for the Brazil (2002), France (2002),
         | and United States (2004) election studies.

         | each of the 5 districts from Pangasinan; instead, turnout for
         | the entire Pangasinan province is entered for each of the
         | respective districts. Single-member districts that belong to a

         | digits of the 5-digit electoral district code reported in B2031.
         |
         | In addition, for several districts from B2031, turnout figures

         | The reason is that some of the parties participated as junior
         | partners in coalitions that obtained parliamentary seats. NP

         | The Philippines Senate (Senado) has 24 members, serving six-
         | years terms. Concurrently with presidential elections, half
         | of the Senate (12 members) is renewed each three years, in a
         | single nation-wide constituency. Senators are elected
         | according to the simple majority, and each voters can cast
         | up to 12 votes. Hence, vote percentages and national totals
         | are not meaningful figures. Candidates from Party A, B, and
         | C were members of K-4 coalition. One additional Senatorial
         | seat (8.33% of 12 seats) was won by another K-4 member - party
         | 13. PRP (People's Reform Party). In total, K-4 won 7 and KNP
         | coalition won 5 Senatorial seats.

         | In the Polish Senate election, voters have more than one vote 
         | (alternatively 2, 3, or 4); thus the number of valid votes is
         | usually higher than the number of voters; it also differs 
         | across constituencies; moreover, some people tend to use less
         | votes than they are eligible to (e.g. in constituencies where 4
         | senators are elected some voters vote for 4 candidates, some
         | vote for 3, some only for 2 candidates etc.). Hence, it was not
         | possible to obtain a 'meaningful percent vote each

         | "Rebirth of Russia" in the 2003 Duma election. In the Duma
         | election, the block of Rebirth of Russia attained 1.9% in the
         | popular vote. The party is ideologically categorized as a "party
         | of the power", as "United Russia", because the party is
         | established and exists to support the government of
         | President Putin. Therefore, we coded ideological family of the
         | party as 16, as it is for "United Russia". Because of its minor
         | status (below 3% of the vote), the party is not reported in

         | 1921.

         | Parties are identified in Appendix I.

         | The Coding scheme for B5013 was revised from the previous
         | version, in order to clarify the difference between a "European
         | Political Party" and a "European Parliament Political Group".
         |
         | The European Union recognizes a "European Political Party" as a
         | political party organization operating transnationally in Europe
         | and provides funding, based on the Treaty of Maastricht.
         |
         | On the other hand, in the European Parliament, these "Political
         | Parties" ally themselves into "European Parliament Political
         | Group" with a few other independents, for the convenience of
         | their activities in the Parliament. Consequently, the "Groups"
         | function as parties within the Parliament.
         |
         | For example, the Liberal Democrats in Britain affiliates with
         | the ELDR: European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, one of the
         | European Political Parties. ELDR in turn consists of ALDE,
         | Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, one of the
         | European Parliament Political Groups, with EDP and some other
         | representatives with affiliations neither with ELDR nor EDP.
         |
         | Even though European Parliament Political Groups function as
         | political parties in the EP, we code each national party in
         | B5013 based on the "Party", while indicating to which
         | "Group" each "Party" belongs. Although they act within the
         | framework of the "Group" in the European Parliament, most of the
         | political parties in Europe keep their affiliations with each
         | European Political Party. Moreover, because some of the groups
         | were formed quite recently (for example, ALDE in 2004), the
         | codes become ambiguous if we provide the codes based only on the
         | "Group" and the survey was conducted before 2004.
         |
         | "Code 12. EUROPEAN DEMOCRATS (ED)" does not have legal status
         | as a "European Political Party" any more. It is a sub-group
         | within EPP-ED groups, though EPP has a dominant position within
         | the group. ED is treated as a "party" in the coding because of
         | its non-trivial historical position in the European Parliament.
         |
         | Similarly, "Code 62. NORDIC GREEN LEFT ALLIANCE (NGLA)" does not
         | have official status as a "European Political Party" because
         | it has representatives only from a few Nordic countries.
         |
         | Therefore, currently a total 10 political parties hold official
         | status as being a "European Political Party".
         |
         | In 2004, EUROPE OF DEMOCRACIES AND DIVERSITIES, the political
         | group at the European Parliament that existed since 1999.
         | merged with other Eurosceptic parties and developed into
         | INDEPENDENCE/DEMOCRACY GROUP. AIDE and EUD continued to
         | affiliate with INDEPENDENCE/DEMOCRACY GROUP.
         |
         | In 2007, IDENTITY, TRADITION AND SOVEREIGNTY (ITS) was
         | recognized with formal status as a European Parliament political
         | group. The group consists mainly of far-right and nationalist
         | parties. However, the group is not included in this coding
         | system because Module 2 does not have any surveys after their
         | foundation.

         | Socialist People's Party in Denmark, coded as Party E in Module
         | 2, is a member of the NORDIC GREEN LEFT ALLIANCE (code 62),
         | though in addition it holds observer status in the EUROPEAN
         | GREENS (code 41). The party affiliated with the GUE-NGL in the
         | European Parliament until the 2004 election. However, after the
         | election, MEP of the party chose to sit with the Greens-EFA in
         | the Parliament. For the purpose of the appendix, the party is
         | coded as 62, i.e. the party belongs more to the GUE-NGL rather
         | than the Greens-EFA, reflecting the status at the point of 2001,
         | when the survey was conducted.
         |
         | Currently, the party is member of the NORDIC GREEN LEFT ALLIANCE
         | as a party at the European level but affiliated with
         | the Greens-EFA in the European Parliament, that differed from
         | the other parties in the NGL. This is the exceptional case at
         | which the coding system does not work well.

         | significant party not represented in the Duma either before or
         | after the election. However, as for the 2003 Duma election,
         | Yabloko (RDPY), Union of Right Forces (SPS), Agrarians (APR)
         | and Pensioners (RPP) all received more than 3% of the votes in
         | the party-list voting, but could not clear the 5% threshold.
         | Therefore, even though they in total attained 9 seats in
         | single-member districts, they had too few deputies to form an
         | organized caucus in the Duma after the 2003 election.

         | As the 2004 Russian election was presidential, not legislative,
         | it is coded as "8. NOT APPLICABLE" here. However, it is very
         | plausible that "The Kremlin" and "The Bureaucracy" used their
         | government resources to influence the campaign.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2004): B5017

         | "No. There was a great deal of speculation that Ralph Nader's
         | campaign for president might influence the outcome of the
         | presidential election, particularly by drawing support away
         | from the Democratic candidate John Kerry. However, Nader's vote
         | share was very small and concentrated in states in which Kerry
         | won and so the effect of Nader's campaign was not decisive in a
         | simple and straightforward manner. Some people thought that
         | independently sponsored initiatives forbidding gay marriage
         | generated increased turnout among culturally conservative Bush
         | voters. The accumulating evidence suggest this was not the case.
         | In general, new campaign finance laws that limited donations to
         | parties encouraged the participation of "independent" groups.
         | One example is the Swift Vote Veterans for Truth who ran
         | anti-Kerry ads. Another is Move-On.org which ran anti-Bush
         | advertisements. The overall effect of these efforts, however,
         | is not clear."
         |
         | Note that while the United States election in 2004 was
         | presidential, some Congressional elections were run
         | concurrently, and thus this question applies.

                  Force to Iraq, Kidnap issue with North Korea).
             117. Britain's participation in Iraq War eroded public
                  trust in Prime Minister Tony Blair, but Conservative
                  leader, Michael Howard, was not well received.
             118. In the wake of "9/11" many voters were very concerned
                  about the number of asylum seekers admitted to Britain,
                  and immigration more generally.
             119. Immigration concerns were linked in the public mind to
                  concerns about crime and terrorism. The Conservatives
                  focused their campaign heavily on this triumvirate of
                  issues, but made only limited headway.
             120. Voters continued to be concerned about health care,
                  education and public service delivery more generally.
                  However, there were widespread doubts that the
                  Conservatives would do a better job that the incumbent

                  Democracy by the opposition and media.

         | in the election is included here:
         |
         | 75. Economic events: the economy was not going as well as
         |     in 2000.
         | 76. Energy crisis: there was an energy crisis in mid-2001.
         |     The population had to cut its consumption and the
         |     economic growth has diminished. Governmental popularity
         |     dropped a great deal after the energy crisis.
         | 77. Division within the governmental coalition: there was
         |     a serious strife among PSDB, PFL and PMDB who were the
         |     major parties underpinning Cardosos Government. PFL
         |     decided to support another candidate while PSDB and
         |     PMDB support Serra, the official candidate.
         | 78. The professionalism of PT electoral campaign. Unlike
         |     the others presidential elections, in 2002 PT did a
         |     very moderate campaign, abandoning completely the
         |     radical stances.
         | 79. Non-proved corruption scandals against Cardosos government.
         |     Those scandals were part of the division within the
         |     governmental coalition.

         |
         | "Under the very firm leadership of Prime Minister Viktor
         | Orbn (formally or informally the number one leader of
         | the Fidesz-MPP ever since 1990) the 1998-2002 government
         | was perceived by the public as relatively efficient, albeit
         | many of the government's policies were controversial and
         | divisive. Economic growth was fairly high throughout the
         | entire term of the Orbn-government, and the income position
         | of the bulk of the population improved in the last two years
         | of the government. It remained disputed though to what
         | extent the strong growth of the period was the result of the
         | policies of the previous (socialist-liberal) governmental
         | coalition, and to what extent the Orbn-government allowed
         | growth to transform into income increases for the many."

         |
         | CSES CODE: 66. ALLEGED CORRUPTION AND DECLINE OF FKGP:
         |
         | "The FKGP's record in the 1998-2002 government was perceived
         | dismal in terms of competence, nepotism, sleaze, and policies.
         | Meanwhile Fidesz-MPP developed credible commitments on all
         | issues traditionally associated with support for the FKgP,
         | and the better part of the 1998 FKgP-electorate switched to
         | Fidesz-MPP.

         |
         | CSES CODE: 67. SUCCESSFUL RIGHT-WING TURN OF FIDESZ-MPP:
         |
         | "Since 1997, Fidesz-MPP developed a range of controversial
         | (though with the larger part of the electorate rather
         | popular) policy commitments in fields like housing, family
         | policy, government relations with foreign investors, and
         | policies regarding the Hungarian minorities living in the
         | neighboring countries. These initiatives solidified support
         | for the party among the potential electorate of the more
         | traditional, Christian- and moderately or radically
         | nationalist right-wing parties, and also extended the
         | support basis for the right beyond its traditional
         | electorate.

         | 68. ALLEGED DISRESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC RULES:
         | BY THE GOVERNING PARTIES
         |
         | "Most of the socialist-liberal opposition to the Fidesz-led
         | government focused on questioning the commitment of Fidesz,
         | Orbn, and the right-wing general to democratic procedures, and
         | associating them with sleaze, corruption, abuse of power,
         | unproductive nationalist stances in foreign policy rhetoric,
         | and a social policy which neglected the interest of the
         | pensioners and the poor in favor of supporting middle to high
         | income families.

         |
         | 69. ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN
         |
         | "Throughout the 2002 campaign it was widely accepted that
         | Fidesz-MPP would easily win the election and stay in power. In
         | retrospect many observers and participants thought that this
         | impression led to a probably less intense campaigning by the
         | center-right than would have been possible and necessary. In any
         | case, after the opposition parties took a clear lead in the
         | first round of the election, a very energetic, assertive, and
         | negative campaign by Viktor Orbn led to a significant surge of
         | the right-wing vote (as well as turnout) in the second round of
         | the election, which nearly turned around the final outcome of
         | the election.

         |
         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         | 122. The split of the opposition: The opposition did not field a
         |      single candidate against the current administration paving
         |      the way for the candidacies of four different candidates
         |      against the incumbent administration which basically split
         |      their chances of garnering enough votes to win the election.
         | 123. The citizenship case against the leading opposition
         |      candidate: During the first months of the campaign, groups
         |      who were allegedly identified with the administration filed
         |      a disqualification case against the leading opposition
         |      candidate claiming that he is not a natural born Filipino
         |      since his parents were allegedly foreign born. The case
         |      took some time to be resolved. Some observers believed
         |      that this case eventually affected his candidacy.
         | 124. The alleged misuse of government funds to help fund the
         |      campaign of the administration candidate: Some sectors of
         |      the society along with the different opposition groups were
         |      complaining because they believe that the incumbent

         | 125. Sickness of Another Opposition Candidate: During the last
         |      month of the campaign an alternative opposition candidate
         |      abruptly went to the United States. The opposition
         |      candidate did not specify his reason for leaving. He just
         |      assured the public that his candidacy would go on. Upon his
         |      return he called a press conference revealing that he was
         |      currently sick but was treated while he was in the U.S.
         |      After the revelation, succeeding surveys revealed that
         |      there was a shift in voting preference that benefited the
         |      current administration.
         | 126. Disorganized Voters List: During election day, there were
         |      many complaints because so many voters were allegedly
         |      disenfranchised or were exasperated to go to the voting
         |      centers because of disorganized voters list in many
         |      precincts. Most of the voters complained that they could
         |      not find their names or that their voting precincts were
         |      allegedly changed.

         | allowed to give only one party name on the ballot.

         | There was an 'electoral alliance' between the two incumbent

         | The answer is YES because in theory electoral alliances can be
         | formed legally. However, in practice the question is vague.
         | There was some informal agreement which enables the parties
         | concerned to cooperate in the Election in question."

         | parties participate under their own names and with their own

         | Taiwanese electoral law does not allow the formation of
         | electoral coalitions between political actors. However, they do
         | emerge de facto among political actors. For example, the 2004
         | presidential elections were contested by two electoral
         | coalitions, both of them composed of more than one party. But,
         | and according to the collaborator, these were not formal nor

         In some electoral systems, there are electoral districts that are
         geographically nested but not otherwise related for purposes of
         seat allocation. In Lithuania, for example, there are 71
         single-member districts that operate under a majority runoff
         system, and also a single nation-wide district that operates under
         proportional representation (the largest remainders method with
         the Hare quota). Neither votes nor seats from the single-member
         districts transfer to the nationwide district, however. The two
         processes are entirely independent (with voters having one vote in
         each district). In this case, the nationwide district, although it
         contains the 71 single-member districts, is not considered to be
         secondary. It is primary. One might say that there are two
         segments to the electoral system in such cases.

         QII.A.1.  How many segments (as just defined) are there in the

         | In some systems there are some seats reserved to be allocated in
         | such a way that corrects for discrepancies between the
         | proportion of votes a party receives and their share of the
         | seats in the legislature (i.e., a "corrective tier"). Because
         | the allocation of seats in a corrective tier is not independent
         | of the distribution of votes in a particular segment- in fact,
         | it is this distribution that determines the allocation of seats
         | in the corrective tier- the presence of corrective tiers has no
         | bearing on the number of electoral segments. Only those
         | characteristics of directly elected tiers are reported in these

         | principle. The remaining 40 seats are decided on the basis of
         | party list votes cast in a single nation-wide district (second
         | segment). To qualify for seats in the proportional segment, a

         | 40 seats disputed in the larger multimember district

         | An electoral district is defined as a geographic area within
         | which votes are counted and seats allocated. If a district
         | cannot be partitioned into smaller districts within which votes
         | are counted and seats allocated, it is called primary. If it can
         | be partitioned into primary districts, and during the counting
         | process there is some transfer of votes and/or seats from the
         | primary districts to the larger district, then the larger
         | district is called secondary. If a district can be partitioned
         | into secondary districts (again with some transfer of votes
         | and/or seats), it is called tertiary.

         | districts) include seven islands, of which, 5 elect a senator
         | each, while Gran Canaria and Tenerife elect 3 each. Balearic

         | "They have as much votes as the number of seats in their
         | district (between 1 and 34 depends on the cantons). "Each voter

         | Lists with names of the candidates of his/her district (canton),
         | and one (official) empty List. "Voters can choose one of the
         | party lists. They also have the possibility to create their own
         | list by filling the empty list in with the candidates they want.
         | They can modify a list (e.g. add candidates from other parties
         | instead of some candidates of the list (panachage), delete
         | candidates, vote twice for a candidate (cummulation).
         |
         | "Voters are not allowed to vote for more candidates than the
         | number of seats in their district. If they vote for less
         | candidates (than district seats), the remaining votes go to the
         | party indicated on the list. In the case no party is indicated
         | the remaining votes are lost. All candidates belong to a party,
         | so that if voters cast a single vote for a candidate, this vote
         | automatically counts for that candidate's party list. The number
         | of seats in the national council is shared between parties
         | proportionally to the results of the ballot. Then within parties
         | - candidates who get the highest amount of votes get the seats.

         |
         | Dil ireann (House of Representatives) in Ireland employs
         | the Single Transferable Vote (STV) System. Therefore, B5039_1 is
         | coded as 1 (voters choose single candidates) and B5040 is coded
         | as 1 (vote is transferable).
         |
         | Be careful that even though voters choose single candidate (with
         | ranking) in their districts under STV and coded as 1 in B5039_1,
         | the STV has much different mechanism from the other systems
         | where people also choose single candidate but vote transfer is
         | impossible, such as Single Member District (SMD) used in both of
         | the US houses or the Single Non Transferable Vote (SNTV) which
         | has been used in the Japanese lower house until 1993.

         | addition to the ones specified in the dataset. The third segment
         | consists of six single member districts in the region of
         | Trentino-Alto. In addition to the plurality winner in each
         | district, there is a remaining seat that is assigned as follows:
         | for every party or coalition, votes are summed across all six
         | single-member districts; for every party or coalition that wins
         | one or more single-member district, the votes of the winning
         | candidate are subtracted from the total. After this subtraction,
         | the party or coalition with most votes is awarded the remaining
         | seat. The fourth segment is represented by a single member
         | constituency in the region of Valle D'Aosta. In this segment,

         | The voter can in no way indicate a desired direction of vote
         | transfer. However, votes cast for a particular candidate in a
         | single-member district, or a particular list of candidates in
         | a multimember district often turn into 'remainder votes' that
         | do not earn mandate in the primary district, but are cumulated
         | at the national level where they benefit candidates who stand
         | for election on the national list of their party.

         |
         | Dil ireann (House of Representatives) in Ireland employs
         | the Single Transferable Vote (STV) System. Therefore, B5039_1 is
         | coded as 1 (voters choose single candidates) and B5040 is coded
         | as 1 (vote is transferable).
         |
         | Be careful that even though voters choose single candidate (with
         | ranking) in their districts under STV and coded as 1 in B5039_1,
         | the STV has much different mechanism from the other systems
         | where people also choose single candidate but vote transfer is
         | impossible, such as Single Member District (SMD) used in both of
         | the US houses or the Single Non Transferable Vote (SNTV) which
         | has been used in the Japanese lower house until 1993.

         | For the purpose of seat allocation the whole country is divided
         | into 11 PR districts. Then the single-member districts are
         | connected with corresponding PR districts. There are two
         | categories of candidate in PR districts:
         | (1) Candidate for PR only,
         | (2) Candidate both for PR and a single-member district.
         |
         | The share of PR seats for each party is determined by D'Hondt

         | candidates according to the list the party formally set at the
         | beginning of an election. The list has priority numbers and
         | allocation of the PR seats follows this list. If one is a

         | Parties that did not pass the electoral threshold are excluded

         | distributed proportionally to the number of votes obtained in
         | the whole country (by the formula of D'Hondt). The total number
         | of seats won by each individual party nationally is subsequently
         | distributed among its regional lists proportionally to the votes
         | cast for each regional list (again by the D'Hondt formula). Then

         | Seat allocation between the lists is done by D'Hondt's
         | method. However, the Chilean electoral system has some further
         | complications. Usually named the "binomial system", in each
         | district voters elect two deputies. While the first seat goes to
         | the candidate with the plurality of the vote, the allocation of
         | the second seat depends on the overall results of the winning
         | coalition. If two candidates from the same list (coalition)
         | obtain together double the amount of votes of the alliance
         | coming in second, both candidates from the first alliance are
         | elected. Otherwise, the candidate from the alliance coming in
         | second with the highest share of votes is elected for the
         | second seat.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2002): B5043_1
         |
         | "The electoral system in Ireland is a proportional
         | representation single transferable vote system (PRSTV). Voters
         | put a '1' beside their most preferred candidate, a '2' beside
         | their second most preferred candidate, and so on. Voters can
         | express as many preferences as there are candidates running in
         | their constituency. On the first count, candidates are declared
         | elected if they attract enough first preference votes to pass a
         | specified threshold, which is defined separately for each
         | constituency according to the formula: [total valid votes/
         | (total number of seats +1) +1]. If a candidate is declared
         | elected on the first count, the second preferences of the
         | candidate's surplus votes (i.e., votes over and above the
         | threshold) are then distributed among the other candidates. If
         | this redistribution does not push any of the remaining
         | candidates over the threshold, the candidate with the lowest
         | number of votes is eliminated, then the second preferences of
         | the eliminated candidate's votes are redistributed. This process
         | of redistribution of surpluses and elimination of candidates
         | continues until all the seats in a given constituency are
         | filled. (For details, see Gallagher et al., 2003, Appendix 4)."
         |
         | Owing to the quota formula: [total valid votes/(total number
         | of seats "+1") +1], the STV system in Ireland works similarly
         | as the party-list proportional representation which uses
         | the largest-reminder method with droop quota. Consequently,
         | B3039_1 of IRL_2002 is coded as 33.
         |
         | Please be careful that because Ireland uses STV instead of PR,
         | there are non-trivial differences between the electoral system
         | of Ireland and the other countries with the PR, for example,
         | "residual" votes go to the next preferred candidates in the STV
         | but in the PR to the next listed/ranked candidates, even though
         | both systems employ "droop" quota for the seats allocation.

         | The 300 single-member districts elect deputies by plurality or
         | first-past-the-post system. The five multimember districts or
         | circunscripciones elect 40 members each through proportional
         | representation. Circunscripciones and single-member districts
         | are geographically overlapping. Each circunscripcion encompasses
         | a similar number of districts. To allocate multimember seats the
         | vote cast in single-member districts is added up to calculate
         | new totals at the circunscripcion level. Two systems are
         | employed to accord seats to political parties. Firstly, a
         | quotient is calculated by dividing the total number of votes in
         | the circunscripcion by 40. The quotient represents the
         | number of votes a party must gather in order to gain one
         | multimember seat in the circunscripcion. Secondly, once parties
         | have been granted seats according to the quotient system, if
         | there are any seats left they will be apportioned to the parties
         | that have the largest remaining vote. The remaining vote is a
         | portion of the quotient that is left after dividing the party's
         | vote cast by the quotient.

         | rounding it off is equal to at least six percent of the total
         | valid votes cast for all party list groups, then the top party

         | overall. If the proportion of votes without rounding off is
         | equal to or greater than four percent, but less than six
         | percent, then the first party shall have one additional seats
         | for a total of two seats. If the proportion is less than four

         | Political parties can form alliances in all Federal elections.
         | There are three possibilities:
         |
         | 1. Two or more parties can nominate the same presidential
         | candidate only if they also agree on a single slate of
         | legislative candidates (in the Chamber of Deputies and in the
         | Senate, both single-member and multi-member districts
         | candidates).
         |
         | 2. Two or more parties can produce a single list of candidates
         | for the 200 proportional representation seats in the Chamber of
         | Deputies and the 32 proportional seats in the Senate (5 regional
         | multi-member districts in the case of the Chamber of Deputies
         | and one national multi-member district in the case of the
         | Senate), only if they agree on the same slate of candidates for
         | the 300 simple majority deputies and the 32 three-member federal
         | districts for the Senate.
         |
         | 3. Two or more parties can form a partial alliance to nominate
         | candidates running for the Chamber of Deputies in single-member
         | districts if the number of common candidates postulated is
         | between 33 and 100, otherwise the parties must commit to a total
         | alliance. I the case of the Senate, two or more parties can form
         | a partial alliance to nominate candidates of simple majority if
         | the number of common candidates postulated is between 6 and 20,
         | otherwise the parties involved must commit to a total alliance

         | encourage their voters to cast an electorate vote for a small
         | party ally - for example National for Act in 1996, and Labour

         | "The country is divided into two general types of territorial
         | administrative units:
         | A. Municipalities - the unit of local self government. Local
         | municipal authorities are elected every 4 years directly by the
         | citizens registered to live in the particular municipality.
         | B. (28) Administrative regions/districts. The district
         | authorities are assigned by the government. The district
         | authorities are responsible for implementation of the central
         | government's policy."

         | Under a system of devolution (or home rule) adopted after
         | Scottish and Welsh referendums on devolution proposals in 1997,
         | most of the constituent countries within the United Kingdom
         | were given limited self-government. In 1999, the National
         | Assembly for Wales was formed, with powers to amend primary
         | legislation from the UK Parliament. Similarly, the Scottish
         | Parliament -formed in 1999- can refer devolved matters back to
         | Westminster to be considered as part of United Kingdom-wide
         | legislation. Thus, there is an important division of power
         | between the central and regional governments, which leads to
         | classify this country as a federal system.
