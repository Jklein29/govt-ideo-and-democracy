>>> DISTRICT-LEVEL CANDIDATES: HUNGARY (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

010101-200509. CANDIDATE NUMBER 10101 THROUGH CANDIDATE NUMBER 200509

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HUNGARY (1998): CANDIDATES
         |
         | HUNGARY HAS A MIXED ELECTORAL SYSTEMS WHERE EACH VOTER HAS TWO
         | VOTES IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. ONE IS TO
         | BE CAST FOR A CLOSED PARTY LIST IN A "REGIONAL" ("TERULETI")
         | ELECTORAL DISTRICT (E.G. BUDAPEST). THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO
         | 20 SUCH DISTRICTS (THE 19 COUNTIES AND THE CAPITAL CITY OF
         | BUDAPEST). EACH REGIONAL ELECTORAL DISTRICT IS DIVIDED INTO
         | SINGLE-MEMBER DISTRICTS. VOTERS CAST THEIR OTHER VOTE FOR A
         | CANDIDATE RUNNING IN THEIR SINGLE-MEMBER CONSTITUENCY (E.G.
         | BUDAPEST 14).  CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PRIMARY
         | ELECTORAL DISTRICTS. IN THE HUNGARIAN CSES MODULE THE RECALL
         | QUESTION ABOUT CANDIDATES IN THE RESPONDENTS' DISTRICT WAS
         | ASKED VERY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CANDIDATES IN THE SINGLE-MEMBER
         | DISTRICT OF THE RESPONDENTS.
         |
         | THE NAMES OF THE CANDIDATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE THIS TIME.
         | INSTEAD, CANDIDATES ARE IDENTIFIED BY CONSTITUENCY AND THEIR
         | ORDER OF APPEARANCE ON THE BALLOT PAPER IN THE GIVEN
         | SINGLE-MEMBER DISTRICT IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE 1998 ELECTION.
         | THUS, CANDIDATE NO. 11402 IS THE SECOND CANDIDATE ON THE BALLOT
         | PAPER IN THE BUDAPEST 14 CONSTITUENCY, AND CANDIDATE NO. 200410
         | IS THE TENTH CANDIDATE ON THE BALLOT IN THE ZALA 4 CONSTITUENCY.
         | NOTE THAT NO CODES ARE DEFINED FOR CANDIDATES NOT MENTIONED BY
         | ANY ONE OF THE RESPONDENTS, BECAUSE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
         | CANDIDATES FAR EXCEEDED 1000.
