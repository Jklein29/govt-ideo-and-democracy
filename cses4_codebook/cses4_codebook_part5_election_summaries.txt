>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - ARGENTINA (2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2015 Argentine general elections were held on Sunday, October 25, 2015. 
In Argentina there is mandatory voting for those aged 18-70, and there was 
a turnout of 81.03% (Presidential election, 80.9% for Chamber of Deputies
election). The elections were fourfold: a presidential election,
elections to the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House, half of the legislature
up for election), elections to the Senate (one-third of parliament up for
election), as well as elections for local governorships. 
Outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kircher was term-limited. The 
Presidential election was held over two rounds. In the run-off on Sunday
November 22, 2015, Mauricio Macri, a former mayor of Buenos Aires defeated
Daniel Scioli, winning 51.3% of the vote to end 12-years of control of the
Presidency by the Front for Victory alliance. The turnout in the second 
round was 80.8%. 
Outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kircher's Front for Victory 
(Frente para la Victoria, FPV) lost its majority in the Chamber of 
Deputies, losing 24 seats, controlling just 107 in the new chamber. 
The center-right alliance Let's Change (Cambiemos, Cam) led by the new 
President Mauricio Macri increased its seats from 64 to 90.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - AUSTRALIA (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2013 Australian Federal election took place on Saturday, September 7, 
2013. There were two elections: elections for the House of Representatives
(lower house) and the Senate (upper house). In Australia, there is 
compulsory voting, and the turnout among registered voters was 93.2%. 
The Liberal/National Coalition, led by Tony Abbott of the Liberal Party 
won the lower house elections, winning 90 seats in the House of 
Representatives, resulting in a majority of 30 over other parties. The 
result ended six years of Labor rule and marked another turbulent 
milestone in Australian politics as Abbott became the third Prime Minister
in six years, having been sworn in as Prime Minister by Governor-General 
Quentin Bryce on September 17. Labor, led by outgoing Prime Minister 
Kevin Rudd won 55 seats, a loss of 17 compared to 2010. Rudd resigned the
leadership soon after. 
In the Senate elections, over half of the seats were contested (40 out of
76). The Palmer United Party led by mining magnate Clive Palmer made
a breakthrough winning a couple of seats. Neither the Liberal/National 
coalition or Labor controlled a majority, with the balance of power held
by smaller parties including the Greens and the Palmer United Party.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - AUSTRIA (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2013 Austrian Federal election to the lower house took place on Sunday 
September 29, 2013. The turnout among registered voters was 74.9%. 
The outgoing government, a Grand Coalition of the Social Democrats (SPO)
and the Austrian People's Party (OVP) both lost votes and seats, with
both parties recording their worst results since World War II. There were
gains for the Freedom Party (FPO), the Greens, and the new party, Stronach,
a Eurosceptic party, which won 11 seats. On October 9, President Heinz 
Fischer asked Werner Faymann, outgoing Chancellor and leader of the SPO
to form a new government. While the SPO was keen to renew the Grand
Coalition, the OVP was less enthusiastic and explored other coalition
options. They had campaigned on a platform of opposition to new taxes and
promised to introduce measures to free businesses from red tape. However, 
coalition talks between the SPO and OVP began in mid-October and on 
December 16, the Grand Coalition was renewed with Werner Faymann (SPO) 
remaining Chancellor and the OVP leader Michael Spindelegger becoming
Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Finance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2014 Brazilian general elections were held on Sunday, October 5, 2014 
(first round) with a second round of Presidential elections on Sunday, 
October 26. The elections were fourfold: a presidential election, 
elections to Congress (lower and upper house), state governor elections, 
and elections to the state legislatures. In Brazil, there is mandatory 
voting for those aged 18-70, and there was a turnout of 80.6% of 
registered voters in the first round of the Presidential elections 
(turnout in the Chamber of Deputies elections was 80.5% among registered 
voters). In the first round of the Presidential election, no candidate 
received the required majority to avoid a run-off election. In the 
run-off election incumbent President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party
(PT) defeated Aecio Neves of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB)
with 51.6% of the vote. This marked the fourth Presidential victory in 
a row for the Workers' Party. Rousseff's' coalition also retained its 
majority in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), controlling 304 
out of 513 seats, and in the Senate (upper house), controlling 58 of 
the 100 seats.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - BULGARIA (2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2014 Bulgarian parliamentary elections took place on Sunday 
October 5, 2014. The elections followed the resignation of the Oresharski 
government on July 23. Various factors contributed to the early ending 
of the Oresharski government, including the worsening relationship 
between coalition partners, poor results in the 2014 European elections 
for the government, and the selection of Delyan Peevski as head of the 
Bulgarian security agency DANS. 
The turnout rate among registered voters was 51.1%. Boyko Borisov 
(Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria - GERB) succeeded
Plamen Oresharski (Bulgarian Socialist Party - BSP) as Prime Minister. 
Borisov's party, GERB, agreed to form a minority government with the 
Reformist Bloc (RB), a new electoral alliance established in 2013, and who 
had gained 23 seats in the election. The new government also received 
support from two parties, namely the Alternative for Bulgarian 
Revival (ABV) and the Patriotic Front (PF), both of whom had gained seats
in the election, but neither party joined the new cabinet. Overall, 
eight parties/party coalitions gained seats in the election but the 
conservative Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) 
remained the most significant force in parliament, despite losing seats 
and votes, controlling 84 seats out of 240.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - CANADA (2011)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2011 Canadian parliamentary elections took place on Monday, May 2, 
2011. The election followed a vote of confidence on March 25, 2011, 
against the incumbent minority Conservative government, led by 
Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The controversy that preceded the motion 
of confidence was the behavior of a government minister Bev Oda and 
whether she had misled parliament regarding a funding recommendation 
from an agency her department had responsibility for. After a 
parliamentary committee failed to reach a conclusion on this matter, 
a motion of confidence was triggered by the opposition Liberal Party. 
The turnout among registered voters was 61.1%. The Conservatives won the
election, winning the majority government since 2000 with 166 seats
out of 308. Stephen Harper remained Prime Minister and became the first
Conservative Prime Minister to win three terms since John Diefenbaker
in the early 1960s. The traditional dominant party of Canadian politics, 
the Liberal Party, fell to third place in votes and seats for the first time
in its history, winning only 43 seats. The New Democratic Party (NDP), 
under the leadership of Jack Layton, came second and became the official 
opposition for the first time.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - CANADA (2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2015 Canadian parliamentary elections took place on Monday, 
October 19, 2015. The turnout among registered voters was 68.3%. The 
election campaign was one of the longest in Canadian history and was the 
first time a sitting Prime Minister sought a fourth successive term 
of office. Moreover, there were 30 additional seats contested in the 
House of Commons for the 2015 elections, bringing the total number of
seats in parliament to 338. 
The Liberal Party, having suffered its worst result in the election four
years previously (see above review) won a significant victory, winning 
184 seats out of 338, an increase of 148 seats on 2011, on a vote of 39.5%.
Justin Trudeau, the Liberal leader and son of a former prime minister 
Pierre Trudeau became Canada's 23rd Prime Minister. The Conservative Party
came second, winning 31.9% of the vote but losing 60 seats compared with 
its 2011 performance. The NDP under Thomas Mulcair came third and lost 
51 seats.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - CZECH REPUBLIC (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2013 Czech Republic lower house elections took place over two days 
with polling on Friday, October 25 and Saturday, October 26, 2013. The 
election followed a vote of no confidence against the incumbent government 
on August 7, 2013. The incumbent Prime Minister, Petr Necas (Civic 
Democratic Party - ODS), had resigned on June 17 in the wake of a corruption
scandal. The turnout rate among registered voters was 48.5%. 
The Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) won the most seats in the election
(50 out of 200), closely followed by the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens 
(ANO), a party found a year before in August of 2012. Together with the 
Christian and Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), 
CSSD and ANO formed a coalition government that assumed office on 
January 6, 2014. Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) became the new Prime Minister.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2015 Finnish parliamentary election took place on Sunday, April 19, 
2015. The outgoing government, initially a six-party coalition led by 
the National Coalition's Alexander Stubb, had lost the support of the 
Green League and the Left Alliance months before the election in a row 
over the granting of a license to build a nuclear power plant. 
The turnout rate among registered voters in the election was 66.9%. The 
National Coalition (NCP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the two
major parties of the outgoing coalition both lost votes and seats. The 
Centre Party (KESK), led by Juha Sipila received the most votes in the 
poll (21.1%) and led coalition negotiations to form a new government.  
On May 29, 2015, Finland's President Sauli Niinistoe swore in the 74th
Finnish cabinet, a coalition government comprising the three largest 
parties in parliament post the 2015 elections, namely the Centre Party, 
The True Finns (PS), and the National Coalition (NCP). Juha Sipila
became Prime Minister.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2012 French Presidential elections were held across two rounds - the
first was held on Sunday, April 22, 2012, with the second round run-off 
on Sunday, May 6, 2012. Francois Hollande, the Socialist Party (PS) 
candidate defeated incumbent President, Nicolas Sarkozy from the right-wing
UMP in the run-off election, polling 51.6% of the vote, on a turnout of
80.4% of registered voters in the second-round (turnout in the first round 
was 79.5%). It was the first time since 1988 that a Socialist had been 
elected President and the first defeat of an incumbent President since 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing was defeated in 1981. 
In the first round, Hollande (28.6%) had polled ahead of Sarkozy (27.2%), 
with Marine LePen of the National Front (NF) trailing behind in third place
with 17.9%. Francois Hollande was sworn in as President in May 2012 with
parliamentary elections to the French lower house following in June 2012.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GERMANY (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2013 German Federal election to the lower house was held on Sunday, 
September 22, 2013. The turnout among registered voters was 71.5%. Led by 
the incumbent Chancellor, Angela Merkel of the CDU, the Union, the alliance 
between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union 
(CSU) won 41.5% of the vote, a substantial increase on their 2009 
performance. They won 311 seats of the 631 awarded in the election, just 
short of an overall majority. The Union's coalition partner, the Free 
Democrats (FDP) suffered a disaster, losing three-quarters of its vote
share and failing to surpass the 5% threshold, and thus winning no 
parliamentary representation for the first time in its history. The 
Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) narrowly failed to gain entry
into the parliament polling 4.7% of the vote. 
In October, formal talks began between the Union (CDU and CSU) and the 
Social Democrats (SPD) on forming a grand coalition, despite misgivings 
among many SPD members. After five weeks of talks, a deal was agreed 
between the three parties. After acceptance by SPD members in a vote in 
early December 2013, a new coalition was sworn in on December 17, 2013. 
Angela Merkel of the CDU remained Chancellor, the first Chancellor to 
achieve a third-term of office since Helmut Kohl in 1990. SPD 
parliamentary leader Sigmar Gabriel became Vice-Chancellor and Minister 
for Foreign Affairs.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GREAT BRITAIN (2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The British General election was held on Thursday, May 7, 2015. With a 
turnout of 66.7% in Britain (excluding NI, 66.2% across the UK), the 
Conservative Party (Con), the dominant party in the outgoing coalition 
government, won a majority, their first since 1992. The Conservatives won
36.9% of the vote and 331 seats, an increase of 25 seats compared with 
their 2010 performance. The Liberal Democrats (LibDem), the Conservative's
partners in the outgoing coalition, were reduced to a rump party, losing 
three-quarters of its vote share compared with 2010 and winning only 7.9% 
of the vote. It lost 49 seats with four of its five cabinet ministers 
losing, and the party returning to Westminster with only 8 MPs. 
The Scottish National Party (SNP) made an electoral breakthrough. Despite
its independence for Scotland proposal being defeated in a referendum 
the year before, the party won 56 of Scotland's 59 seats. It primarily 
impacted the opposition Labor Party (Lab), who had until then, dominated 
Scottish politics. The SNP surge was a contributory factor to Labor's loss
of 26 seats and its vote share being six points behind the Conservative
Party. 
The election was also notable for the significant vote garnered by the 
United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic party, who while
only winning one seat in the House of Commons, garnered 12.6% of the vote. 
The performance of UKIP and the SNP saw the vote share of the three major 
parties at their lowest level since 1945. David Cameron continued as Prime
Minister with the Conservatives holding a majority of 12 over other parties.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GREECE (2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were two parliamentary elections held in Greece in the summer of 
2012. Elections were not scheduled to take place until autumn 2013 but 
Greece was particularly badly hit by the Global Financial Crisis, with the
country entering a European Union/International Monetary (EU/IMF) bailout 
program in 2010. Early elections were agreed to in November 2011 whereby
a Grand Coalition caretaker government came to power under Lucas Papademos, 
with the support of the major parties in parliament. 
The first election was held on Sunday, May 6, 2012. However, attempts to 
form a government, first by the New Democracy Party, and then by SYRIZA 
resulted in new elections being called for June 17, 2012. The turnout among 
registered voters in the June election was 62.5%. In the June election,  
the New Democrats (ND), led by Antonis Samaras, received the most 
votes, gaining 29.7%. It was closely followed by the Alexis Tsipras led 
Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) which received 26.9%. Five 
other parties also won seats in parliament. 
After the June election, New Democracy (ND) formed a three-party coalition
government with DIMAR and The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the 
party that had been in power when the GFC hit, and which had suffered 
significant losses in both the May and June poll. On June 20, 2012, 
Antonio Samaras of New Democracy (ND) became Prime Minister.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - GREECE (2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2015 Greek lower house elections were held on Sunday, January 25, 2015. 
The elections were held early due to three unsuccessful rounds of voting in
parliament for a new president. Harsh economic conditions as well as
Greece's relations with the European Union dominated the campaign with
parties campaigning specifically on whether to continue to implement
the EU/IMF bailout programs, which Greece had been subject to since 2010
(see above review). 
The turnout among registered voters in the election was 63.9%. The 
coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), which had campaigned against the 
EU/IMF bailout program emerged as the most significant party, winning 
149 seats in the 300 member parliament. It defeated the outgoing coalition 
led by Antonio Samaras of New Democracy (ND), which won 76 seats. A new 
coalition government was formed comprising SYRIZA and the right-wing 
Independent Greeks (ANEL) with Alexis Tsipras as Prime Minister.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - HONG KONG (2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2012 elections to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LeGo) were held
on Sunday, September 9, 2012. In total, 70 seats were at stake: 35 elected
by geographical constituencies where all eligible voters can cast
a ballot, and the remaining 35 by functional constituencies which permits
natural persons but also professional or special interest groups to cast
a vote. Ten additional seats were available due to a 2010 electoral 
reform. Turnout among registered voters in the geographic constituencies
was 53.1%. The pro-Beijing camp increased its seat share, controlling
43 of the 70 seats, an increase of six. 
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) 
won 13 seats, nine of these in the geographical constituency election. 
Its success partly resulted from a splitting of candidates into several
lists, taking better advantage of the largest remainder method for the seat
distribution.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - IRELAND (2011)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2011 Irish general election was held on Friday, February 25, 2011, and
took place three months after Ireland had accepted an EU/IMF bailout. 
The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) badly hit Ireland with the country the 
first EU state to enter recession in 2008. It's banking system, on the 
verge of insolvency, forced the Fianna Fail/Green coalition to issue a 
bank guarantee in September 2008. 
However, the country's economic health continued to deteriorate, 
with unemployment reaching a peak of 14%. By September 2010, the cost of 
bailing out the banks had raised the country's budget deficit to 32% of GDP. 
In November 2010, the Irish government was forced to accept an EU/IMF loan 
which included plans to cut public services and government spending and 
the phased introduction of unpopular taxes on water and property. The Green
Party announced that they intended to withdraw from the government once it
had passed a new budget for 2011 and on foot of this, a spring general 
election was planned. In January 2011, the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister)
Brian Cowen resigned as leader of Fianna Fail. While Cowen had won a vote 
of confidence in his leadership earlier that month, a botched reshuffle of 
his Fianna Fail cabinet forced his resignation. He was replaced by Michael 
Martin. In the election, where 69.9% of registered voters voted, Fianna 
Fail, suffered its worst result ever, losing three-quarters of its vote 
and coming third in the popular vote. Meanwhile, coalition partners the 
Greens lost all their seats. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, had 
their best election ever winning 76 seats. Labor also had its best result 
winning 19.4% and 37 seats. Fine Gael and Labor formed a coalition 
government and Enda Kenny became Taoiseach, the first Fine Gael Prime 
Minister in fourteen years.

The 2013 Israeli lower house election took place on Tuesday, January
22, 2013. The election was called early as incumbent Likud Prime Minister

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - JAPAN (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2013 Japanese upper house elections were held on Sunday, July 21, 2013. 
The turnout rate among registered voters was 52.6% in an election which
saw half of the seats up for grabs (in Japan, half of the upper house
mandates are renewed every three years). 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior
coalition partner, New Komeito, won a total of 76 seats of the 121 seats 
at stake, which including holdovers, resulted in them gaining a majority 
in the upper house, controlling 135 of the 242 seats. The largest opposition
force, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), took only 17 seats which 
reduced their seat total to 59, the party's lowest number of seats since 
its foundation in 1998. The 2013 elections ended the so-called 
'twisted parliament', where both the upper house and the lower house 
were controlled by different parties.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2011 Latvian parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, 
September 17, 2011. The turnout was 59.5% among registered voters. The 
previous elections of 2010 had seen the party Unity (VIENOTIBA) emerge 
as the winners. However, following the parliament's refusal to investigate 
corruption charges against an opposition party, a successful referendum to 
dissolve the parliament resulted in early elections. 
The Unity Party lost 13 points as its vote share slumped to 18.8%, and the
party lost 18 seats. The party Harmony Center (SC) won with 28.4% of the 
vote and 31 seats. It marked the first time a pro-Russian party achieved 
a plurality of the vote in Latvia since independence in 1991. However, 
it failed to form a coalition government with a stumbling block supposedly
Harmony Centre's support of the Russian-speaking minority. Instead, a 
three-party coalition between Zatler's Reform Party, Unity, and the 
National Alliance was formed with Valdis Dombrovskis of the National 
Alliance as Prime Minister.

The 2014 Latvian parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, October 4, 
2014, with a turnout of 58.9% among registered voters. While a legislative
term usually is four years in Latvia, early elections held in 2011 (see 
above summary) meant the legislative term was reduced to three years.
In January 2014, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovski's resigned due to
the Zolitude shopping center roof collapse in which 54 people lost their 
lives. Laimdota Straujuma succeeded him and became Latvia's first female
premier. 
In the October elections, the Social Democratic "Harmony" Party remained 
the largest party in parliament, despite losing 7 seats. However, Laimdota 
Straujuma, head of the Unity Party, retained power as the head of a 
three-party coalition between Unity, the National Alliance, and the Union 
of Greens and Farmers, a green conservative/agrarian alliance, which 
increased its vote share to 19.5% and won an additional eight seats.

The 2015 Mexican lower house election took place on Sunday, June 7, 2015.
Conventionally, elections take place on the first Sunday of July, but for 
this cycle, they were held in June. The election for Chamber of Deputies

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY – NEW ZEALAND (2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2014 New Zealand parliamentary elections were held on Saturday, 
September 20, 2014. Prime Minister John Key announced the election date
in March 2014. Traditionally, elections in New Zealand have been held 
on the last Saturday in November. However, in 2014, this convention 
was not adhered to because of a clash with the G20 summit in Australia 
in November 2014. 
The turnout among registered voters was 77.8%. The National Party (Nat), 
led by incumbent Prime Minister John Key retained government after 
winning 47% of the vote and 60 seats, just short of a parliamentary 
majority. Counts on election night had previously suggested the party might
attain the first majority government since 1994, but the party lost a close
race with the Greens to deny it. The main opposition party, Labor (Lab) 
had its worst election in terms of vote share since 1922 with party 
leader David Cunliffe stepping down after the election. 
After the election, the National Party entered a confidence and supply 
agreement with the United Future (UFNZ), the ACT Party, and the Maori
Party to form a minority government. John Key remained Prime Minister.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - NORWAY (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election took place on Monday, 
September 9, 2013. Welfare issues dominated the campaign. 
Turnout among registered voters was 78.3%. Although outgoing Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg's Labor Party (A/Ap) won the most seats in the Storting 
(Parliament), he was denied a third-term in office, which would have been
a first in Norwegian politics. Instead, the right-wing opposition led by 
Erna Solberg of the Conservatives (H) and which also included the Progress 
Party (FrP) emerged victorious after the Liberal Party (V) and the 
Christian Peoples' Party (KRF) supported a minority coalition. On October
16, 2013, Erna Solberg became Norway's second female Prime Minister 
after Gro Harlem Brundtland.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARY - THAILAND (2011)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

At stake in the elections of July 3, 2011, were 500 seats in the House of
Representatives (up from 480). Elections were held early as on 10 May, 
with the King's approval, the House of Representatives was officially 
dissolved. In all, 3,832 candidates from 42 parties contested the 
elections. The main contenders were Prime Minister Abhisit's
DP - the country's oldest party, which had not won a general election in
two decades - and the PP. The latter endorsed Ms. Yingluck Shinawatra -
former Prime Minister Thaksin's youngest sister - as its candidate for the
premiership. The Yellow Shirts called for a boycott of the elections.
Both the DP and the PP ran on similar platforms, promising to raise the
minimum wage, improve public transportation and provide affordable health
care. 65.99% of the nearly 47 million registered voters turned out at
the polls. The preliminary results gave 265 seats to the PP, effectively
allowing it to form a new government on its own. The DP came in second with
159 seats. On August 5, the House of Representatives elected Ms. Yingluck 
(PP) as the new Prime Minister, the first woman in Thailand to assume the 
post. Ms. Yingluck formed a six-party coalition government, controlling a
total of 300 seats.
