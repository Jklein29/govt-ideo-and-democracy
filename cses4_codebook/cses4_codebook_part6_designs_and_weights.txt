CSES provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable D1010_) namely:

  - SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable D1010_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable D1010_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable D1010_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

Users are advised to read carefully about the different weights in CSES to 
ascertain whether their analyses should be subjected to weighting and if so 
which kind. The CSES project does not provide advice as to which weights are
appropriate to use in particular circumstances. This is best left to 
analysts to decide based on their detailed knowledge of the research 
question under investigation. We advise analysts to consult each Polity's
Design Report on the CSES Module 4 Study Page (see
http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module4/module4.htm). 
For information on derivative weights calculated for the Cross-National 
Dataset, users should consult Part 1 and Part 2 (variables D1011-D1014) 
of the CSES Codebook.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

Elections in Argentina were held on October 25, 2015. The post-election
Interviewing began on November 21 (27 days after the Election day) and
lasted for 39 days, ending on December 30, 2015. The face-to-face mode was
employed for all interviews. The Argentinian election study was conducted
as a panel study in two waves. CSES questions were distributed in the
second wave, which contained in total 1149 respondents. Of those
respondents, 780 had been sampled initially for the first survey (panel
attrition between two waves was 68%), and 369 respondents were a refresh
sample. The fieldwork was conducted by MBC Mori. The questionnaire was
administered in the Spanish language, and the target population for the
study was all Argentian citizens older than 18 years.

A multistage sample design with a total of six stages was used. In the 
first stage, the country's 23 provinces (plus the federal district of 
Buenos Aires) were divided into four electoral strata based on 2011
presidential election results, using as the stratifying variable the 
percentage of valid votes obtained by incumbent Kirchner. Provinces were
classified into these four strata and cities/towns were selected within 
each stratum. Stages two through six were conducted according to standard
household sampling procedures, using different types of probabilistic 
selection procedures at stages two to five, where the population is 
composed of geographic areas or households. These procedures included 
sampling of census fractions and census radiuses with Probability 
Proportional to Size (stages 2 and 3) as well as a simple random sampling
of blocks within census radiuses (stage 4) and systematic random sampling
of households within blocks (stage 5). Finally, a quota procedure was
employed for stage six where individuals within households were sampled.
More detailed information about the sampling procedure is available in
the Design Report.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - AUSTRALIA (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The Australian Election Study was carried out between September 6, 2013 and
January 7, 2014. The mode of the interview was a mail-back questionnaire.
The fieldwork period began one day before the Federal Election on
September 7, and in total took 123 days. The questionnaire was administered
in  English and the fieldwork was carried out by the Survey Research
Centre Pty Ltd. 

The study collected information from voters, that is Australian adults 
aged 18 years or over who were enrolled on the electoral register, and 
eligible to vote. A stratified random sampling procedure was used 
to compile a sample of respondents from the Australian Electoral Register
which is administered by the Australia Electoral Commission (AEC). 
Initially, 15,000 records were provided, 100 from each electorate. 
The sample was provided by the AEC for use only for this study. Due to 
budget considerations, only 12,200 of the original sample
was selected for the initial mail-out. 

The following strategy was used for sub-selection:
1) Randomly select 81 voters from each electorate (totally 12,150)
2) After Step 1, randomly select 1 additional voter from 50 randomly 
   selected electorates.

Sample records with an overseas mailing address were removed from the
mailing sample. A total of 3,955 Surveys (3,379 via mail-back and 576
online) were received.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Australian Election Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. This weight
was calculated to correct for the following: the disproportionate
probability of selection, non-response in the survey, and to match known
demographic characteristics of the population. This weight was calculated
using rim weighting adjusting to four benchmarks. Figures for age,
gender, and the state of residence were obtained from the AEC enrollment
data for the 2013 election. Figures for voting came from the AEC Final
Election Vote Tallies. For the category "(Voted Informal)/Did not vote,"
"Voted informally" is bracketed as this response is included in the
dataset but not in the benchmark. The numbers represent only the number
of enrolled voters who did not vote, i.e., the difference between the
vote tally and the number of enrollments). Counts of invalid votes were
obtained. However, it was impossible to ascertain how many invalid votes
were deliberate (in which the case the respondent would give the
"invalid vote" response) and how many were unintended (in which case the
respondent would most likely not realize their vote was invalid and
respond with their voting intention).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The elections in Austria were held on September 29, 2013. The survey
interviewing began on October 1, and lasted for 29 days. The interviews
were conducted via the telephone by Jaksch & Partner Institute for
statistics. All interviews were conducted in the German language. The total
of 1000 interviews have been completed for the Austrian study, and the
sample is meant to be representative of the Austrian population, persons
aged 16 and older, eligible to vote in the national election 2013. The
sampling method employed was stratified random sampling. The primary
sampling factor was the nine Austrian provinces ("Bundeslaender"). Only
within these provinces, an unlimited random sample was drawn. The
provinces were then divided into administrative districts proportional to
their population size. Phone numbers were randomly selected using dual
sampling frame (RDD: 89.1% and RLD: 10.9%). The last birthday method was
used to randomly select the respondent within each household. The
characteristics used for stratification were geographic (provinces,
administrative districts and city/town sizes).

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Austrian Election Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. These are 
necessary to even out minor offsets in the sample that did not perfectly 
coincide with the target population. It was created on the basis of 
socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, household size, 
region/Bundesland, and employment status).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - BRAZIL (2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The survey was administered between November 1, 2014, and November 19, 
2014. The interviewing started 5 days after the second round of elections
in Brazil. The face-to-face mode was used for the study, and interviews
were conducted in the Portuguese language. The fieldwork was coordinated by
IBOPE Inteligencia.
Sampling was conducted in three stages and is meant to be representative of
the Brazilian population over 16 years that is registered to vote. Random
probability  sampling was implemented in two of the three stages:
I) Cities within stratum (state) [Systematic PPS (Probability 
Proportional to Size)];
II) Census tracts within cities [Systematic PPS];
III) The household selection was made by quota: gender, age, education and 
the line of work.

The primary sampling units are composed of cities. The sample is 
stratified per state. In case of states with metropolitan areas, 
its universe is stratified across metropolitan areas and countryside. 
The cities are probabilistically selected through systematic PPS 
(Probability Proportional to Size) in each stratum, based on the 
population of those above 16 years of age. Through this method, 194 
cities were selected. The total of 3136 interviews were completed in
Brazilian study.
For research reasons, the state of Sao Paulo has a complement sample 
in the capital, suburbs and interior to allow interpretation of the 
results for each of these areas. The selection of cities in the 
periphery and interior follows the same criterion for other strata, 
i.e., systematic PPS based on population aged 16 or more.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Brazilian Election Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT. It is constructed 
to correct for oversampling in the state of Sao Paulo. Oversampling occurred
because of deliberate oversampling of the Sao Paulo region (for more 
details see study design description above). The weights are constructed so 
that complementary sample of the state of Sao Paulo has the proportional 
effect in the whole sample.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - BULGARIA (2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The post-election survey, containing the CSES Module 4 questionnaire,
was conducted between January 23-31, 2015, slightly more than three 
months after the election. All respondents were surveyed in face-to-face 
mode and interviews were conducted in the Bulgarian language. The fieldwork
was coordinated by TNS BBSS SEE research agency in Bulgaria. The total of
999 interviews were completed, and the sample is meant to be representative
of adult (18+ years old) population of people living in Bulgaria.

The sampling points were distributed proportionally to regional and 
urbanization characteristics of the population. The number of sampling
points in each region for the different type of settlements was calculated
based on the ratio regional center/other urban area/rural area. On a 
regional level, separately for each region, the settlements belonging to 
the same urbanization group were put in alphabetical order. The 
settlements included in the survey were selected at random from that list. 
Additionally, for the biggest cities (capital Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna), 
sampling points were distributed in smaller administrative units 
(municipalities) proportionally to the size of the population in the
respective city. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample,
which is estimated to be 3% of total population.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Bulgarian Election Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. It ensures that
the sample is representative of the population. Weights tend to adjust for 
gender, age, urbanization level, and region of residence (NUTSII-level).
These weights were constructed by using a weight matrix based on
information about the statistical distribution of the population
according to the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria.

respondents (n=3,458), and individuals who had already participated in
the Canadian Election Study in 2004, 2006 or 2008 (n = 850). However,
the latter were removed from the CSES data. The interviewing was conducted
via phone, for this phase of the study, and performed by Institute for
Social Research and Jolicoeur & Associates which did interviewing in
Quebec.

The RDD sample for the 2011 campaign study was designed to represent the
adult population of Canada: Canadian citizens 18 years of age or older who
speak one of Canada's official languages, English or French, and reside in
private homes in the ten Canadian provinces. The sample was selected via a
modified random digit dialing (RDD) sample along with the birthday
selection method within households. Residents of the three Northern
territories were excluded from the sample as well as institutionalized
persons and military personnel. That makes around 1.5% of the population.
Additionally, 1.1% of households in Canada are without a phone. The
interviews were conducted in English and French languages.

The sample for the post-election surveys was comprised of respondents to
the CPS. At the end of the CPS, the interviewer ensured that they had a
first name or some other identifier (such as the respondent's initials or
position in the household, e.g., mother). This information, as well as
the sex and year of birth of the CPS respondent, and the respondent's
telephone number was recorded on a "cover sheet."

The elections in Canada were held on May 2, 2011. Calling for the
post-election study (PES) started on May 3. The interviewer called and
asked for the person by name or identifier. By day 30, more than 80% of
the interviews were completed, but small numbers of interviews were only
completed by early July. In total, 3,362 PES interviews were completed,
of which 2,595 were from the new 2011 RDD sample.

At the end of the post-election survey, respondents were asked to provide
their address so they could be sent the mail-back survey (MBS). 30% of the
PES respondents declined to provide an address. The PES respondents who
provided mailing addresses received up to five contacts encouraging them to
complete and return the mail-back questionnaire. The number of mail-back
completions was 1,567. Of those who provided an address and were sent the
MBS, 67% returned a completed questionnaire, and this represents 47% of all
PES respondents.

The Canadian Election Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT. In order to produce
national estimates, this weight correct for both the unequal probability of
selection at the household stage and the unequal probability of selection
based on province of residence. The weight variable is the product of two
original weights, the household, and the province weight.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The study was part of the panel study. Three waves of the panel were
conducted. The first wave, campaign period study (CPS) began on September 8
2015. By the October 19, the Election Day, 4,202 interviews were completed
in the first wave.

Interviews were conducted using the CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone
Interviewing) technique in English and French. Fieldwork was conducted by
Institute for Social Research.

Respondents were drawn from random digit-dialing (RDD), a sample
representing the adult population of Canada: Canadian citizens 18 years of
age or older who speak one of Canada's official languages, English or
French, and reside in private homes in the ten Canadian provinces. The
birthday selection method was used to select respondents within the
households.

Residents of the Northern territories were excluded from the
sample since they are difficult to sample. Additionally, institutionalized
persons, as well as military personnel, were excluded from the sample. The
excluded territories and groups contain around 1.5% of the population.

Post-election study (PES) began on October 20, the day after the election.
All respondents from the first (CPS) wave of the study, that could be
contacted and wanted to take part in the survey, were interviewed. Again,
the CATI technique was used for the PES interviewing. After 64 days, by
the December 23 (last day of fieldwork for PES) 2,988 interviews were
completed. The PES reinterview rate in 2015 was 71%.

The third wave of the study was conducted as a mail-back survey (MBS). In
the PES respondents were asked at the end to provide their addresses so
that they could be sent the mail-back survey. The mail-back survey was
hence sent only to those respondents who voluntarily gave the address and
agreed to participate in this part of the study. Of those who provided an
address at the end of the PES (70%) and were sent the MBS, 62% percent
returned a completed questionnaire. In total, 1,289 respondents completed
and sent back the survey. 

CSES questions were distributed among these three different components.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The Canadian Election Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT. It corrects for 
unequal probabilities of selection at the household stage and the unequal
probabilities of selection based on province of residence. The provided
variable is the product of household weight and a province weight.
Household weight is included because the probability of an adult member
of the household being selected for an interview varies inversely with the
number of eligible adults living in that household. Regarding the province
weight, because the sample was stratified, the distribution is not
proportional to the population size of the provinces. Therefore, the data
must be weighted before national estimates are derived.
Weights are obtained by dividing the proportion of households in the
province by the proportion of the households in the sample for that
province.

28, 2013 and November 14, 2013. The mode of interviews was face-to-face/in
person in the Czech language. The fieldwork was conducted by CVVM (Center
for public opinion research) at the Institute of Sociology, Czech Academy
of Sciences.
 
For the Czech study, respondents were chosen according to a quota system
which was designed for each of the 14 Czech regions (which correspond to
the electoral districts). Quotas were based on age, gender, and education.
The sample includes 1,653 respondents (Czech citizens older than 18 years)
and is meant to be representative of all Czech Republican citizens of 18
years and older. Around 1% of the population, people who don't live in a
house or apartment could not be reached, and that is why were excluded from
the sample.

The CSES Module 4 was implemented in the 2015 Finland Post-Election
study that was carried out in the aftermath of the lower house elections
which took place on April 19, 2015. The survey was administered between
April 24 and July 7, 2015 (fieldwork lasting in total 74 days), using
face-to-face interviews and drop-off questionnaires, in Finnish and
Swedish language. The fieldwork was conducted by TNS Gallup Oy.

The sample is a quota sample that is meant to be representative of all
Finish citizens, 18 years and older, who were entitled to vote in 2015
Finish parliamentary election. In the first stage of the sampling
procedure, the population was divided based on gender and age. The number
of respondents required for the sample was then divided along NUTS2 
regions and in a next step, along municipality lines. Interviewers
were conducted with those persons in targeted households that fulfilled
the age and gender criteria. Within their areas, interviewers themselves
could choose any household, i.e., they were not provided with a list of
target households by the survey company. 

Excluded from the sample were all Finish citizens living in the region of
Asland Islands (equivalent to 0.49% of the total eligible population).
Overall, 11,500 people were selected from the sampling frame. 1,587 of
the selected people completed the interview. Of the 1,587 respondents,
684 returned the drop-off questionnaire which they were offered to fill
out immediately after the interview (to be returned by mail). The
drop-off questionnaire included questions on eight different variables
from the CSES core module. For more information, see election study
notes for variables D1007 (Sample Component) and D1023 (Survey Mode) in

Interviews were held face-to-face in the French language.

The sample is meant to be representative of the eligible population, French
citizens, who are 18 years or older and registered to vote.
Institutionalized persons and 4.5% of the population living in the overseas
territories were excluded from the sampling frame because of the costs
linked to interviewing in these regions. The sample was drawn as a
stratified three stage probability sample. For the stratification, a table
with 21 regions and five agglomeration classes were built. Each cell
contained the corresponding population size. In the first stage of the
sampling, 400 primary sampling units (districts) were allocated to the
defined cells, using Cox's 'Method of controlled rounding.' The PSUs
(municipalities, arrondissements of bigger cities or villages grouped in
cantons) were selected from the cells according to the allocation
proportional to population size. In the second stage, 5 (+20) addresses of
the PSUs were selected via the random route. Failed addresses could be
replaced by an extension of the random route. In stage three, individuals
within households were selected via the 'Last-Birthday-Method.' In total,
2009 interviews were completed in the France election study.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The CSES module is part of the German post-election cross-sectional study, 
for which the fieldwork was conducted between September 23 and December 23, 
2013, by MARPLAN Media- und Sozialforschungsgesellschaft mbH. Data 
collection started one day after the federal election on September 22 and 
lasted for 92 days in total. The questionnaire was administered in German 
and in person (CAPI).

The sample is designed to be representative of all German citizens resident
in the Federal Republic of Germany, who were living in private households, 
aged 18 or older, and who were eligible to vote. Originally the sample also
included an additional number of 19 persons of age 16-17, but these were 
excluded from the CSES as they are not eligible to vote. 

The sampling method used was the Address-Random Method (ADM) design, with 
all private German households as the base population. 306 sampling points
(voting districts) were randomly selected - 211 in West Germany and 95 in
East Germany. In West Germany, 1,400 interviews or 6.6 interviews per
sampling point on average were aimed for and in East Germany 700, or 7.4
interviews per sampling point on average, resulting in an oversampling of
East Germany. In every sampling point, 60 households' addresses were 
randomly selected using the random  route sampling. From this list of
confirmed addresses, 25 households per sampling point were selected 
randomly. The third step was the selection of the target person via the
Kish-Selection-Grid. A minimum of four attempts were made to contact a
potential respondent, at different times of the day and days of the week,
before declaring it a non-contact. There are 1889 completed interviews in
the sample.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The CSES module was part of the British Election Study post-election cross-
sectional survey. The survey was conducted between May 7 and September 29, 
2015, a timespan of 146 days, with data collection beginning the day of the
election. GfK UK Ltd was responsible for data collection. Whereas the main
study was conducted face to face (CAPI), the CSES module was administered
separately via self-completion after the interviewer had left the household.
Respondents were free to complete the questionnaire either via paper-and-
pencil (PAPI) or online (CAWI). All interviews were conducted in English.
The sample was designed to be representative of citizens living in Great
Britain, aged 18+ and who were eligible to vote in the 2015 general 
election. Those who are eligible to vote are British Citizens, Citizen of
the Republic of Ireland or citizen of a Commonwealth Country who has a 
"right to remain" in the UK.

The sample was selected based on a multi-stage design, summarized as:
1) A stratified random sample of 300 Parliamentary constituencies (primary
sampling units)
2) Two Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) per constituency were selected
with probability proportional to size
3) Selection of addresses from the Small user Postcode Address File (PAF)
4) One individual randomly selected per address by the interviewer

The exclusion of the Northern islands from the sample led to the exclusion
of about 0.25% of the eligible population. Additionally, some sections of 
the population fell outside this sampling frame, e.g. elderly people in
residential care, prisoners and military personnel living in defense 
establishments. This led to the exclusion of another 2% of the eligible
population. 

1567 respondents completed the main study and the CSES module. Before the
study, all respondents received an incentive of 5 GBP together with a letter
announcing the survey. After completion of the main study, participants
received gift vouchers with varying values. Another voucher worth 5 GPB was
given to those respondents who announced participation in the self-
administered CSES module. For initial non-contacts, incentives were raised
from 5 to 15 GBP.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The British Election Study includes two different weights: a SAMPLE WEIGHT 
and a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT.
The Sample weight corrects for unequal selection probabilities, which might
have occurred whenever an interviewer was left with the following choices:
1. To select a dwelling (typically flats) from a selected address 
2. To select an individual household from a dwelling
3. To select an eligible person from the household
A person's chance of being interviewed was calculated by multiplying the
number of dwellings by the number of households within the selected 
dwelling, multiplied by the number of adults in the selected household. 
As the probability of selection is the inverse of this number, respondents
were weighted by the result of the multiplication. The selection weight was
capped at 5 (affecting 14 cases). Afterwards, the weight was rescaled to
arrive at the original sample size.

The Demographic weight accounts for differing levels of response from 
various groups in the population. For this second weight, demographics that
were corrected were age, gender, and region, based on the Office for 
National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates for 2014. 
The demographic weight was calculated after the selection weights had been 
applied.

The 2012 Hellenic (Greek) National Election Voter Study was conducted as a
mixed-mode survey in the period between October 19, 2012 and January 5, 
2013. Fieldwork started 124 days after the second 2012  parliamentary
election on June 17, 2017 and lasted for 79 days. The Aristotle University
of Thessaloniki, School of Political Sciences, Laboratory of Applied 
Political Research and To The Point Research Consulting Communication S.A.
were responsible for data collection. The questionnaire was administered in
Greek.

The sample was designed to be representative of Greek voters, that is, Greek
citizens with a minimum age of 18 registered to vote (with registration
taking place automatically for all citizens born in 1994 or later). Half of
the sample was designed to be collected online, complemented by face-to-face
interviews. This is because collaborators expected that the 55+ age group
would be greatly under-represented in the web survey sample, as the rural
population. In contrast, the regions of Attiki (region of the capital 
Athens) and Thessaloniki were expected to be over-represented.

The online sample was selected randomly (using RDD) by area proportional to
total population. Thus, households were the primary sampling unit. The
selected respondents were called and asked to provide their email address in
case they agreed to participate. The face-to-face sample was designed as a
cluster sample, with the regions of Attiki and Thessaloniki being excluded
because of prior expectations outlined above. In each selected cluster,
systematic sampling was used, i.e. the interviewers selected the first house
randomly, continuing in the cluster by selecting every kth house. 
Additionally, a quota on age was employed, with 30% of respondents aged 54
or younger. There are 1029 completed interviews in the sample, of which 500
were realized face-to-face and 529 online.

The 2015 Hellenic (Greek) National Election Voter Study was conducted as a
mixed-mode survey in the period between June 12 and September 8, 2015.
Fieldwork started 138 days after the legislative election on January 25,
2015 and lasted for 89 days.
The Aristotle  University of Thessaloniki, School of Political Sciences was
responsible for data collection. Interviews were conducted in Greek. The
sample is meant to be representative of Greek citizens with a minimum age of
18 who were registered to vote (with registration taking place automatically
for all citizens born in 1996 or later). 

Initially, respondents were recruited via telephone (CATI), with households 
being the primary sampling unit. Therefore, Greek households without a phone
were excluded from the sampling frame (about 18 % of the eligible
population). The main data collection phase was implemented as a web survey
(CAWI). For respondents neither having access to the internet nor an e-mail
address, telephone interviews (CATI) were conducted as an auxiliary method.
The recruitment of the respondents was based on a random selection of
telephone numbers, that is, Random Digital Dialing (RDD). Before the initial
selection process, the geographical area was sampled at the first stage, the 
area code was identified and the telephone numbers were completed during the
second stage by random sampling. The recruitment process lasted from June 12
until July 16. The individual who answered the phone call was asked to 
participate in the survey after verifying that the respondent was eligible 
to vote.Selected respondents were asked to provide their e-mail address in
case they agreed to participate in a web survey conducted by the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki. Every e-mail address collected during the 
recruitment phase was uploaded to the epolls.gr web survey system and an 
e-mail with the invitation and the link to the survey was sent to the
respondent. Invitations were also sent to about 400 respondents of the 2012
voter study who had indicated that they would be willing to participate in
future ELNES surveys. In the following weeks after the initial invitation,
reminders were sent to the respondents who had not completed the
questionnaire. To increase the response rate of the survey, a maximum of six
follow-up reminders was sent via email to the respondents. 1008 respondents
completed the interview.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The study was conceptualized as a post-election telephone survey and
conducted between September 13 and September 21, 2012, a period of nine 
days. Fieldwork realized by the Public Governance Programme started four
days after the Legislative Council election on September 9. The 
questionnaire was administered in Chinese (Cantonese and Putonghua). The
sample is meant to be representative of the eligible (Chinese- speaking)
voting population in Hong Kong, which is defined as permanent residents of
Hong Kong who are aged 18 or above and registered to vote. Institutionalized
persons, who make up to 0.3% of the population, were excluded from the
sample. The same is true for military personnel, who are from mainland China
and hence do not have permanent residency. Other possible exclusions could
result from an unknown percentage of residents without a fixed-line phone
connection. The residential fixed-line penetration rate of 2012, which is
100.6%, was used as a proxy. As some households have more than one fixed 
line, the number of households without a fixed line is unknown. The total
percentage of excluded persons from the sample was estimated to accumulate
to less than 1%.  

Two stages of random sampling were used to generate the sample. In the first
stage, samples of phone numbers were selected randomly from the pool of the
Hong Kong Telephone Directory. The last two digits of the sample numbers 
were exchanged with random numbers. In the second stage, individual
respondents were randomly selected from the eligible members of the
respective households, which were the primary sampling unit. Interviews were
conducted via the CATI mode. All interviewers were undergraduate students of
the Lingnan University who had received basic training in survey interviews
and the CATI system. Before declaring a household a non-sample, five trials
of contact at different times and days were made. The average number of 
contact attempts made per successful interview was 1.69. If a household
refused the interview on the first call, a second contact attempt was made
to ask for the interview. In total, the dataset contains 1044 completed
interviews.

The CSES Module was included in a post-election telephone study which was 
fielded between May 4 and September 10, 2013, amounting to a period of 130
days. Data collection was realized by the Social Science Research Institute
of the University of Iceland and started one week after the parliamentary 
election on April 27, 2013. The questionnaire was administered in Icelandic.
The sample is meant to be representative of Icelandic voters between 18 and
80 years of age. Eligibility requirements include the age of 18 onwards and
Icelandic citizenship. Voters do not need to register themselves before
elections. Apart from persons under age or non- citizens, a group of persons
listed on a "Do not call" list in the national register was excluded from
the sampling frame. This latter group amounts to around 9.9% of the total
eligible population. Further, persons without access to a landline or mobile
phone could not be sampled. According to the Post and Telecom Administration
in Iceland, this pertains to less than 1% of the population. 

The sample is a simple random sample of voters living in Iceland, which was
drawn from the National Register. Therefore, individuals were the primary
sampling unit. Every individual had the same probability to be selected.
Before the respondents were interviewed by phone, a letter was sent to them.
Persons who did not speak Icelandic, were not reachable within the time-
limit of the survey, too sick to reply or passed away were designated as
non-sample. The average number of necessary attempts to contact a person per
household was 5.4 times. In total, the dataset includes 1479 completed

The study was conceptualized as a mixed- mode post-election survey and
conducted between March 6 and April 10, a period of 36 days. Data collection
started nine days after the Irish general election on February 25, 2011. The
interviews of the main survey were conducted in English and in person,
supplemented by a drop-off self-completion questionnaire. CSES questions
were spread through both questionnaires. The Irish sample restricts to Irish
citizens aged 18 years and older, excluding institutionalized persons and
military personnel based on a military facility (about 3% of the total
eligible population).

The sampling process involved multiple stages. The primary sampling unit
consisted of 320 geographical locations, so-called district electoral
divisions (DEDs), which are low-level administrative areas.In these DEDs
covering all 43 electoral districts, a non-business address was chosen at
random from a geo-directory as the starting point for a random walk. The
interviewer was asked to call into every fifth house rather than one
consecutive house after another. At each household, the interviewer
interviewed the person with the next birthday who fitted into an unfilled
quota. This approach was continued until all sampling point-specific quotas
were achieved. Quotas were set on gender, age, and social class, making use
of the Irish Census lists. In total 1853 people of voting age were
interviewed, with 18 to 66 respondents per constituency. The employed
interviewers were all professional interviews from the Red C Research &
Marketing Ltd, the Irish research center responsible for data collection.
Note that the Irish election study was a CSES pilot study, based on an
earlier pilot version of the CSES Module 4 questionnaire, and not the final
version. Any differences with the final version of the CSES Module 4
questionnaire are spelled out in the Election Study notes for IRELAND 
(2011).

population without a stationary phone and an unknown proportion of the
population with unlisted telephone numbers. 

All survey respondents were sampled in a three-stage random sampling
process. The primary sampling units were statistical areas, stratified by
religion, the geographical area, religiosity and the socio-economic level of
respondents. All of the statistical areas were sorted by strata, such that
the probability of each statistical area to be included in the sample was
proportionate to the size of its population. In the next stage of selection,
households were sampled in every stratum, based on matching the telephone
number database with the statistical area sampled. The list of telephone
numbers used for surveys included stationary telephone line owners, numbered
in sequential order. The sampling was performed out of this list. In the
final stage, each interviewer received a list of households (telephone
numbers) to be interviewed. Within the selected household one adult 18 years
old or above was interviewed, without any further specification. The
resulting sample consists of 1,017 completed interviews.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The post-election study for CSES Module 4 was carried out between July 22 
and August 25, 2013, as a face-to-face survey. Fieldwork lasted for 35 days.
Data collection was realized by the Nippon Research Center, starting the day
after the Japanese Upper House election on July 21, 2013. The questionnaire
was administered in Japanese and translated back into English. The original
sample was part of a panel study with a population of registered Japanese
voters aged 20 years or older. Additional addresses were added to this 
sample to enlarge the total sample size. The CSES module is included in the
last wave of the four-wave panel survey.

Therefore, the CSES survey contains three different types of respondents:
a) The respondents from the first wave: n1 = 365.
b) The respondents drawn for the second wave from the same PSU: n2 = 535.
c) The respondents drawn for the fourth wave from the same PSU: n4 = 1037. 
The total number of respondents is 1,937: N = n1 + n2 + n4.
Please note that no additional sample was drawn for the third wave. The
total panel attrition rate between the first wave of the study and the wave
that included the CSES Module is 85.1%, as 365 of the 2443 respondents of
the first panel wave were successfully re-interviewed in wave four.

The initial sample was selected through stratified two-stage random
sampling. Electoral district's “chiten” (comparable to precincts in the US)
were the primary sampling unit, stratified by region (eleven categories) and
city size (five categories). This resulted in an 11 x 5 table with 55 cells.
The number of chitens (150 in total) was assigned to each cell proportion-
ally to the size of the population. The probabilities of the particular
chiten's selection were proportional to the relative size of the chiten.
Lists of registered voters compiled by municipalities served as the sampling
frame for the second stage of the sampling process. Nippon Research Center
fielded 143 interviewers for 150 primary sampling units during the data
collection period. Interviewers were mostly female. Before the interview,
respondents received a postcard announcing the interview. Additionally,
respondents received a voucher worth 1000 Japanese Yen (roughly 10 USD)
after the completion of the interview.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The post-election study was administered between October 21 and November 28,
2013, as a face-to-face survey. Fieldwork lasted for 39 days. Data
collection was realized by the Institute for Development Studies, University
of Nairobi, starting seven months and 18 days after the Kenyan general
election on March 4, 2013. Interviews were conducted in English, Luo, Kamba,
Kikuyu, and Kiswahili. 

The design is a representative cross-sectional sampling based on a
stratified multistage cluster sampling methodology. The sample consists of
1200 respondents, and only Kenyan citizens of voting age (18 and older) were
targeted. Inmates and military personnel were excluded from the sample. The
primary sampling unit (PSU) was the census enumerator area, the secondary
sampling unit (SSU) was the parliamentary constituency. The 210 SSUs were
stratified by province and within each province by whether a constituency
was predominantly urban or rural. 30 constituencies were selected with
probability proportionate to sample size (PPPS), out of which ten were urban
and 20 were rural. Within each constituency, Enumeration Areas (EAs) were
randomly selected (PPPS). In turn, a fixed number of households were
randomly selected from each sampled EA. Furthermore, a quota was employed
for gender.

The Kenyan Election Study contains a SAMPLE WEIGHT. It makes the sample 
representative of the population. Of the 30 constituencies selected for the 
study, some were oversampled to obtain a representative set of answers for 
the MP questions. Weights were constructed by province and compensate for 
the disproportionate probability of selection. They are meant to match the 
population by region and the urban-rural population distribution.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN 

The study was a post- election face-to-face survey and conducted between 
October 16 and November 7, 2011. TNS Latvia was responsible for data 
collection, starting 29 days after the Latvian election on September 17. 
Interviews were conducted in Latvian and Russian. The sample is meant to 
be representative of Latvian citizens residing in Latvia, who are between 
18 and 74 years old. About five percent of the eligible population were 
excluded from the sampling frame. 

The sample can be described as a stratified multistage-quasi-random
probability sample. In total there were four stages within the sampling
process: 
1) the selection of sampling points; 
2) the selection of addresses; 
3) the selection of households; and 
4) the selection of respondents.

Primary sampling units were sampling points which were selected system-
atically from the complete list of Latvia's populated points, with the
number of citizens as a size measure (Probability Proportional to Size).
Populated points were sorted by region, district and urbanization level to
keep regional and urban proportions in the sample. The planned number of
sample points was calculated with the assumption of 10 interviews in each
sample point. A random number determined the point in the list of cities or
parishes from which the selection began. In the second sampling stage, the
random starting address for an interviewer's route was selected within each
sampling point. The selection within urban areas was based on lists of
dwellings (addresses). In a third stage, households were selected according
to route instructions - each second dwelling in apartment buildings, each
second home in an area of individual houses; ascending or descending se-
quence varying on odd and even sizes of streets. Finally, respondents were
sampled from households by "the principle of the youngest man in the
household". This principle demands that at each address, the interviewer
clarifies who of the household members being at home is the youngest man. If
no man is at home, the youngest woman within the household is asked to
participate in the interview. If a respondent refused to participate or had
not been contacted within two visits, the respondent was not replaced by
another household member. After participating in the interview, respondents
received a small gift (chocolate or pen). The sample contains 1004 completed
interviews.

The study was conducted as a face-to-face, post-election survey. Data
collection, conducted by TNS Latvia, started on November 7, 2014, 34 days
after the Latvian parliamentary election. The last interviews were conducted
on November 20, 2014. Questionnaires were administered in Latvian and
Russian. The sample is representative of the Citizens of the Republic of
Latvia, aged 18-74, residing in Latvia. About five percent of the eligible
population were excluded from the sampling frame.

Respondents were selected in a four- stage quasi-random probability sample.
For the first stage, a systematic PPS-sample (Probability Proportional to
Size) of sampling points was selected from the complete list of Latvia's
populated points, with the number of citizens as a size measure. Populated
points were sorted by region, district and urbanization level to keep
regional and urban proportions in the sample. The planned number of sample
points was calculated with the assumption of 10 interviews in each sample
point. A random number determined the point in the list of cities or
parishes, from which the selection began. Starting from this point,
considering certain steps, cities or parishes, to be included in the sample,
were selected. From each sampling point, a random starting address for an
interviewer' route was selected, based on lists of dwellings. Households
were then selected according to the route instructions – each second
dwelling in apartment buildings, each second home in an area of individual
houses; ascending or descending sequence varying on odd and even sides of
streets. In the last step, the youngest man that was present in the
household was selected to be interviewed. If no man was at home during the
interview, the youngest woman within the household was asked to participate
in the interview. If a respondent refused to participate or had not been
contacted within two visits, the respondent was not replaced by another
household member. After participating in the interview, respondents received
a small gift (chocolate or pen). 1036 respondents completed the interview.

This post-election study was conducted face- to-face between July 13 and
July 19, 2012, and focused on the 2012 Mexican presidential and legislative
elections. CAMPO, S. C. was responsible for data collection, which lasted
for seven days and started 12 days after the general election on July 1. The
questionnaire was administered in Spanish. The study is representative of
the national population aged 18 years or older, excluding those who were
institutionalized at the time the survey was being conducted (approx. 0.06%
of the total eligible population).

The sample was selected by a multistage procedure. The universe was divided
into four regions: states with a PAN governor, Northern States with a PRI
governor, Center-South states with PRI governors and states with a PRD
governor. An independent sample was drawn within each region. In each
region, precincts were ordered by the vote for PRI in the last election and
divided into four groups of the same number of precincts. Within each group,
precincts are clustered by county. This resulted in groups from the same
county with a similar vote for PRI, which served as the primary sampling
unit. The first selection stage was done with this list, clustering 
precincts within each group with probability proportional to size (PPS),
being turnout the size of the cluster. In the second stage, precincts were
selected with PPS. Fieldwork teams received the sample of precincts. In the
field, the third stage, blocks were randomly selected in the precinct area.
In each block, houses were selected following systematic methods of random
start. Within each household, respondents were chosen with the last-birthday
method. In case the selected household member could not be interviewed after
two contact attempts, interviewers moved on to the third household on the

Mexican legislative election on June 7, 2015. Interviews were conducted in
Spanish. The study is representative of the national population aged 18
years or older, excluding those who were institutionalized at the time the
survey was being conducted (approx. 0.06% of the total eligible population).

The sampling was done in a multistage procedure. The universe was divided
into three regions: states with a PAN governor, states with a PRI governor,
and states with a PRD governor (stratification). An independent sample was
drawn within each region. In each region, precincts were ordered by the vote
for PRI in the last election and divided into four groups of the same number
of precincts. Within each group, precincts were clustered by county
(municipality), resulting in groups with a similar vote for the PRI and
located in the same county (municipality). These groups served as the
primary sampling unit. The first stage selection was executed on the basis
of this list, clustering precincts within each group with probability
proportional to size (PPS), being turnout the size of the cluster. In the
second stage, precincts were selected with PPS. Fieldwork teams received the
sample of precincts. In the third stage of sampling, blocks were randomly
selected in the precinct area. In each block, houses were selected following
systematic methods of random start. Respondents within the households were
randomly selected by listing all household members over 18 years and
determining which birthday was closest to the current date. In case the
selected household member could not be interviewed after two contact
attempts, interviewers moved on to the third household on the left. The
sample consists of 1197 completed interviews.

meant to be representative of the eligible Montenegrin population aged 18
years or older. It consists of mainly five ethnic groups, Montenegrins,
Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians, and Muslims. 

The sampling was conceptualized as a multistage random procedure, with three
stages in total: In the first stage, the population was divided into three
regions, stratified by the proportion of the population, the distribution of
ethnic groups within a region, age groups, and the region's geography,
economy and history. These regions were the primary sampling unit. Second,
'mjesna zajednica' (the smallest municipal unit which is at the same time a
unit for voting) were chosen randomly within a region. In the third and
final stage, a random procedure based on 'step-and-go' was employed inside
of 'mjesna zajednica' to choose the household. The last person to have had
their birthday within the household was interviewed. 967 respondents

The study is a post-election, mixed-mode survey, which was fielded between
September 10, 2013, and January 30, 2014. Data collection was realized by
Statistics Norway, starting the day after the Norwegian parliamentary
election on September 8 and 9, 2013. Interviews were conducted in Norwegian, 
either by phone or face-to-face. Those whose phone number was not listed
were interviewed face-to-face. The sample is meant to be representative of
the Norwegian citizens aged between 18 and 80. Norwegians living abroad for
more than six months were excluded from the sampling frame (1.6 % of the
eligible population).

The sample was drawn from the public register as a cross-sectional
probability sample. It is part of a rolling cross-sectional panel study with
about half of the sample being interviewed for the second time. The sample
consists of 1727 respondents aged 18-79 who were sampled in a two-stage
design by Statistics Norway. The sampling frame is based on registers
covering all Norwegian inhabitants. In the first stage, the country was
divided into 363 primary sampling units (psus), based on the local munici-
palities. All psus with more than 30,000 inhabitants and some with a 
population number between 25,000 and 30,000 constitute separate strata. For
the remaining psus, strata were formed as homogeneously as possible.
Stratification variables were industrial structure, number of inhabitants,
centrality, communication structures, commuting patterns, trade areas and
(local) media coverage. The stratification was done separately for each
county and in such a way that no psu had less than 7% of the total
population in its stratum. Thus, it is possible to give unbiased estimates
for each county. After stratification, one psu was selected from each
stratum. Those psus which constituted separate strata were included with
certainty. For the remaining strata, one unit was drawn with probability
proportional to the number of inhabitants. In the second stage of the
sampling, survey units (individuals) were drawn from the population
register, selected from the 109 sampling areas, using systematic random
sampling. The sampling fraction at the second stage is proportional to the
inverse selection probability at the first stage. The final sample then is
self-weighting when both stages are taken into consideration. If a sampled
unit from the panel sample had moved out of their original psu, it was still
included in the sample. Before the interview, respondents received a letter
announcing the study.

The Instituto de Opinion Publica de la Pontificia Universidad Catolica del
Peru was responsable for data collection, starting 27 days after the first
election round on April 10, 2016. Interviews were conducted in Spanish. The
sample is meant to be representative of registered Peruvian voters with a
minimum age of 18. The 35 provinces of 19 regions of the country where the
interviews were done covered approximately 67.7% of the national population,
such that 32.3 % of the total eligible population were excluded from the
sampling frame. The same holds for institutionalized persons (0.3%), which
were not interviewed either.

The sample was selected by a multi-stage stratified sampling procedure with
stratification according to geographical units. Clusters representing either
housing blocks in cities or towns in rural areas were defined as primary
sampling units. The random selection at the first stage was executed with
probabilities proportional to cluster size. At the second stage, households
were randomly selected from the drawn clusters using systematic sampling.
Within households, individuals were chosen according to sex and age quotas
with a maximum of one individual being interviewed per household. Households
were contacted once, and non- residential sample points, vacant households,
or households in which all members were ineligible were declared non-
samples. No non-sample replacement methods were used. However, in cases of
refusal in a selected household, replacement was performed in the adjacent
houses in the same housing block. The sample contains 1572 completed 
interviews.

results of the first presidential election round. 
The political weights are absent for 123 cases: 105 respondents who did not 
cast a vote in the presidential elections (D3005_PR_1) and 18 respondents 
who did not specify their vote choice in the presidential elections 
(D3006_PR_1). These cases were coded 0 on the political weighting variable
and will thus be dropped from the analysis if the weight variable 
is applied to analysis.

The study was conducted with face-to-face interviews which were held between
June 24 and June 27, 2016. The Social Weather Stations were responsible for
data collection, which started 46 days after the Philippine presidential and
legislative elections on May 9, 2016. The survey was fielded in seven
languages (Filipino, Iluko, Hiligaynon, Cebuano, Bicol, Waray and Maranao)
and is meant to be representative of Philippine citizens aged 18 years and
older. 

Multi-stage probability sampling was used to select sample spots. In a first
step, the country was divided into four study areas: The National Capital
Region (NCR), Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. From all areas except
the National Capital region, 21 provinces were selected altogether, with
probability proportional to size within each region. In a second stage, 140
sample municipalities were identified within the sample provinces and the
National Capital Region. From these, 60 sample spots, the primary sampling
unit (Barangays), were selected within each of the four regions, with
probability proportional to size (PPS). In the next stage, in each of the
sample spots, five sample households were chosen by systematic sampling. 
Designated starting points were randomly assigned - it was either: 
1) a municipal/barangay hall, 2.) a school, 3.) the barangay captain's 
house, 4.) a church/chapel/mosque, 5.) a health facility, or 6.) a basket-
ball court. From there, a random start from the first to the 6th household
was defined. Thus, if a particular spot had a random start of 4, the first
sample household should be the 4th household from the designated starting
point. Subsequent sample households were chosen using a fixed interval of 5
households in between the sampled ones; i.e. every 6th household was 
sampled. In the last stage of the sampling, a respondent was randomly chosen
among the household members who were 18 years of age or older, using a
probability selection table. The sample contains 1200 completed interviews.

the Public Opinion Research Center (Centrum Badania Opinii Spolecznej, 
CBOS), started 11 days after the Polish parliamentary election on October 9,
2012. The questionnaire was administrated in Polish. The study collects
information from voters (Polish citizens aged 18 years or over, registered

In the first stage, 81 strata were selected based on 16 regions 
(voivodeship) and the size of the municipalities (six categories). Strata
were obtained as an intersection of region and municipality size. As not
every type of municipality occurs within each region, the number of strata
was 81 instead of 96. In a second stage, municipalities were sampled in each
stratum according to Hartley-Rao scheme. Next, for each selected
municipality one street (or village in case of rural areas) was drawn. In
each stratum, at least two streets or villages were sampled.  Finally, for
each street (or village) eight respondents were drawn based on their
National Identification Number. The sample consists of 1919 completed 
interviews.

The post-election study was administered between October 17 and December 9, 
2015, as a face-to-face survey. GfK Portugal - Metris was responsible for
fieldwork, which started 13 days after the Portuguese legislative election
on October 4, 2015. Interviews were conducted in Portuguese.
The sample is meant to be representative of individuals aged 18 years or
older, who were living in private households in continental Portugal at the
time the survey was being conducted. Portuguese citizenship was not required
to participate in the interview. The autonomous  regions (archipelagos) of
Madeira and Azores were excluded from the sample frame (4,87% of the 
eligible population). The same holds for institutionalized persons (about
0,13%).

The sample was stratified according to NUTS and habitat. As the autonomous
regions of Madeira and Azores were not included in the sample,
stratification of primary sampling units (urban areas and rural districts)
 was done in the five first-level NUTS existing in Continental Portugal:
Lisboa (the capital), Norte, Centro, Alentejo, and Algarve. The random
selection of towns was carried out in accordance with the places included in
the General Population Census, considering the matrix sampling of NUTS and
habitat. 

In each designated town, sample points were selected randomly (105 in
total). Afterward, households were selected through the random-route 
method. Finally, in each household, the person who had the most recent
birthday was selected for the interview. Substitution of individuals was
permitted. If the selected person was not available, three more visits were 
made in an attempt to reach the potential interviewee. After a fourth
unsuccessful visit, the selected individual was replaced by another person
with similar characteristics (sex, age group and habitat) from a different
household. 
Prior to the interview, a letter was sent to respondents. The sample
consists of 1499 completed interviews.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - ROMANIA (2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The CSES Module 4 was implemented in the 2012 Romania Post-Election study
and consists of two components, a cross-sectional component and a post-
election survey from a two-wave Pre-/Post-Election panel. Interviews were
carried out in the aftermath of the lower house elections, which took place
on December 9, 2012. Fieldwork, which was conducted by KANTAR TNS (CSOP), 
started six days after the election and lasted from December 15, 2012, to
January 30, 2013. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in Romanian. 
This sample is meant to be representative of the non-institutionalized
eligible Romanian population, i.e. Romanian citizens of at least 18 years.
As the sampling frame is based on Romanian's electoral register, only
registered voters were sampled. Although registration happens automatically,
the register only covers persons listed by local authorities. Therefore,
unlisted persons were excluded, as were institutionalized persons (amounting
to around 0,5% of the total eligible population).

The sample can be described as a stratified two-stage probability sample. 
Stratification was based on 18 cultural areas and seven types of 
municipalities (poor communes, medium developed communes, developed 
communes, cities with less than 30,000 inhabitants, cities of 30-100,000
inhabitants, cities of 100-200,000 inhabitants, cities with more than
200,000 inhabitants), resulting in 96 different strata. 
Voting districts from the Local Elections in 2012 were used as the primary
sampling unit (PSU). The number of PSUs to be selected within a stratum was
obtained by multiplying the sample size n with the share pi of each stratum
in the electorate (i.e. proportional to the number of registered voters 
within a stratum). Then, ten respondents were chosen randomly from the
electoral register of each selected voting district, resulting in the main
sample. Another ten respondents were selected for a reserve list to
compensate for refusals, using the same procedure. The final sample included
1,248 households for the panel component (1,080 completed interviews) and
1,763 for the cross-sectional component (1,203 completed interviews). The
panel attrition rate between the pre- and the post-study of the panel
component was 13.5%. Respondents of the panel-component were offered a 
10 RON (about 3 USD) food coupon after participation, or in case they were
reluctant to participate. 

Overall, the 2012 Romanian sample includes 2,283 respondents (20% of the
interviews were verified in the aftermath of the study). 

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2012 Romanian Election Study includes three weights: a SAMPLE WEIGHT, a
DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT, and a POLITICAL WEIGHT. 

The Sample Weight (D1010_1) corrects for the variance in the probability of
being selected into the sample, an issue that arose from different poll 
sizes. 

The demographic weight (D1010_2) is designed to match known characteristics
in the population (gender and age) and further accounts for residence 
(urban/rural) and region (Transylvania, Muntenia, Moldavia, and Bucharest).

The political weight (D1010_3) corrects for discrepancies between the 
reported vote choice and the actual election results. 

The demographic and the political weight are cumulative weights, that is,
the demographic weight also takes the sample weight into account and the
political weight takes  both the sample and the demographic weight into 
account. The weights were created separately for each of the two sample 
components (see D1007). Therefore, they can be applied when working with the
full sample.

The CSES Module 4 was implemented in the 2014 Romania Post-Election study.
Interviews were carried out in the aftermath of the second round of the
Presidential Elections which took place on November 16, 2014 (Round one took
place on November 2, 2014). Fieldwork conducted by KANTAR TNS (CSOP) started
four days after the second round on November 20, 2014, and ended on December
8, 2014. Interviews were conducted in Romanian.

This sample is meant to be representative of the non-institutionalized
eligible Romanian population, i.e. Romanian citizens of at least 18 years.
As the sampling frame is based on Romanian's electoral register, only
registered voters were sampled. Although registration happens automatically,
the register only covers persons listed by local authorities. Therefore,
unlisted persons were excluded, as were institutionalized persons (amounting
to around 0,5% of the total eligible population).

The sample can be described as a stratified two-stage probability sample,
with stratification of the primary sampling units (voting districts for the
2014 presidential elections) proportional to the number of secondary units
(adults registered in the electoral register). Specifically, voting
districts were stratified with regard to 8 regions of development and 7
types of municipalities (rural areas under 2000 inhabitants, with 2000 to
4000 inhabitants and more than 4000 inhabitants; as well as cities under
30,000 inhabitants, cities with 30,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, cities with a
population of 100,000 to 200,000 people, and cities with more than 200,000
inhabitants). This way, 53 strata were created. Voting districts were
selected from each stratum, proportional to their number of registered
voters. In the second stage, ten respondents were selected by systematic
random sampling from the electoral register of each selected voting
district, resulting in the main sample. A reserve sample of ten respondents
was selected to compensate for refusals, using the same procedure. The final
sample includes 1112 completed interviews. 20% of the interviews were
verified in the aftermath of the study.

The 2014 Romanian Election Study includes three weights: a SAMPLE WEIGHT, a
DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT, and a POLITICAL WEIGHT. 

The Sample Weight (D1010_1) corrects for the variance in selection
probabilities of individual respondents. The demographic weight (D1010_2) is
designed to adjust the sample to known characteristics in the population
(gender and age) and further accounts for residence (urban/rural) and
region. Finally, the political weight (D1010_3) corrects for discrepancies
between the reported vote choice and the actual election results for both
Presidential Election Rounds simultaneously. 

The demographic and the political weight are cumulative weights, that is,
the demographic weight also takes the sample weight into account and the
political weight includes both the sample and the demographic weight. All
weights were created by dividing the known population distributions by the
sample statistics.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The CSES Module 4 was included in the Serbian Post-Election Study, running
from December 21, 2012, until February 10, 2013, using face-to-face,
computer-assisted interviews. Ipsos Strategic Marketing conducted fieldwork,
starting 229 days (i.e. 7,5 months) after the Serbian parliamentary election
on May 6, 2012, which was held simultaneously with the first round of the
presidential election. Interviews were conducted in Serbian, but the
questionnaires were also prepared in Hungarian and Albanian.

The Serbia Public Opinion Study is designed to be a representative national
sample of eligible voters in Serbia (i.e. adult citizens aged 18 on election
day older). Institutionalized persons and military persons were excluded
from the sampling frame, as were the regions of Kosovo and Metohija (about
8% of the total eligible population).

The sample is address-based, using the database provided by the national
post office of Serbia (Posta Srbije). For mail delivery, Posta Srbije
divides the country into geographic regions named Reons. At the first
sampling stage, the project team randomly selected a set of 150 lines from
the database, i.e. intersections of settlements and postal Reons. These
lines were the primary sampling unit. For each Line, the Posta Srbije was
asked to provide the addresses from odd-numbered PAKs (Postal Address Codes)
for residential households. In addition to the addresses, the Posta Srbije
also provided the number of households per address. This allowed the project
team to convert the list of addresses to a list of households. From among
the list of households, 3300 households were randomly selected with equal
probability, aiming for 1800 completed interviews. If more than one
household member was found to be eligible, the respondent was randomly
selected from within the respective household. After completing the
interview, respondents received a package of coffee as a thank-you gift.
Furthermore, for respondents who were reluctant to participate, interviewers
left a letter at the household.  Additionally, they were offered another
package of coffee. The sample contains 1568 completed interviews.

The CSES Module 4 was implemented in the 2016 Slovak Post-Election study 
that was carried out in the aftermath of the lower house elections that
took place on March 5, 2016. TNS Slovakia s.r.o. was responsible for data 
collection, which started 222 days (i.e. 7 months and 8 days) after the 
election. The survey was administered between October 13 and November 28, 
2016. Interviews were conducted face-to-face and in Slovak. This sample is
meant to be representative of the eligible Slovak population, i.e. citizens
of at least 18 years who have permanent residence in Slovakia.

The sample was randomly drawn in two stages. First, territorial units, the 
primary sampling units, were randomly drawn from the Slovak register
containing all communities (i.e., villages and cities). Selection was based
on the proportion of eligible voters within a community and community size. 

In total, 220 territorial units were drawn. Households for interviews within
these territories were then selected by random walk. Three to eight
interviews were carried out in each of the selected units. Of all eligible
persons within the household, the person with the closest birthday was
selected for the interview. 

The final sample includes 1150 completed interviews. 10% of the interviews
were verified by calling respondents back and asking them about their
characteristics and control questions that were included in the
questionnaire.

This post-electoral study was carried out via face-to-face interviews
between March 29 and May 28, 2012. Fieldwork, which was realized by CJMMK
(Public Opinion and Mass Communication Research Centre), started 116 days
(i.e., 3 months, 25 days) after the Slovenian parliamentary election on
December 4, 2011. The questionnaire was administrated in Slovenian. 
The study's sampling frame corresponds to the Central Register of Population 
(CRP) and includes all residents older than 18 years with a permanent 
address, including both citizens and non-citizens. Institutionalized people
were excluded from the sampling frame (less than 1% of the total eligible
population).

The study employed a two-stage stratified random sample from the Central
Register of Population, where every population unit has an equal selection
probability. So-called clusters of enumeration areas (CEAs) were the primary
sampling unit (PSU). In the first stage, 120 PSUs were selected with
probability proportional to the size of the respective CEA. The CEAs were
stratified according to 12 regions x 6 types of settlements. At the second
stage, 15 people were selected (120x15) by systematic random selection
inside each CEA. Persons selected from the Central Population Register were
identified by name and address. No efforts were made to persuade respondents
who were reluctant to be interviewed. However, respondents received a letter

by Citizen Surveys and started 271 days (i.e., 8 months, 26 days) after the
South African general election on May 7, 2014. Interviews were conducted in
eleven different languages (English, Afrikaans, Ndebele, IsiXhosa/Xhosa,
SePedi/North Sotho, SeSotho/South Sotho, SetTswana/Tswana, Shangaan, Swazi,
Venda, and IsiZulu/Zulu). The sample is meant to be representative of adult
South African citizens, aged 18 or above. Institutionalized persons and
military personnel were excluded from the sampling frame (about 0,43% of the
total eligible population).

Within each EA, interviewers were sent to a random starting point which had
been marked on a map of the EA. From this starting point, interviewers
turned into a designated direction, selecting every 10th household by
considering dwellings on both sides of the street. Once the household was
chosen, the interviewer had to randomly select the individual respondent. A
quota was employed for gender, such that every other respondent had to be
female. For the random selection of respondents within the household,
numbered cards were assigned to each member. Afterwards, the head of the
household was asked to randomly select one of these. In case a household was
vacant, all members of a household were ineligible, the selected person did
not answer after two callbacks or refused to participate, interviewers were
instructed to move to the next house in the walking pattern. Substitution
within a household was not permitted. The sample includes 1300 completed

the Korean Social Science Data Center. Interviews were conducted in Korean.
The sample is meant to be representative of registered South Korean voters
aged 19 and above. People living on Cheju Island and other small islands
were excluded from the sample frame. This is common for Korean national
surveys, as people living in these regions are difficult to contact and make
up less than 0.5% of the population. 

A multistage sampling procedure was used in which electoral districts
represented the primary sampling units. 80 electoral districts were randomly
selected from a list of all electoral districts. At the second stage, voting
districts within each sampled electoral district were randomly sampled. In a
final step, a simple random sample of voters could be drawn within each

for fieldwork, which started the day after the Swedish general election on
September 14, 2014. Interviews were conducted in Swedish.

The study is conceptualized as a two-wave rolling panel design, meaning that
respondents are contacted in two successive elections. Thus, while half of
the respondents were already interviewed in 2010, the other half was newly
sampled in 2014. This latter half of respondents were randomly drawn from a
list of all Swedish voters who were eligible to cast their vote in the 2014
Swedish National Election. Therefore, individuals were the primary sampling
unit. Eligible Swedish citizens living abroad were excluded from the sample
frame (about 2% of the population). 

The sample is meant to be representative of Swedish citizens living in
Sweden who were entitled to vote and between 18 and 80 years old. However,
due to the two-wave panel design, the 2014 sample includes some respondents
sampled in 2010 who are older than 80. Overall, the sample is composed of 
832 completed interviews from respondents of ages 18 to 84. To facilitate

The Swiss interviews were held between October 24 and November 24, 2011, by
telephone, in French, German or Italian. Fieldwork was conducted by
DemoSCOPE RESEARCH & MARKETING and started the day after the Swiss federal
election on October 23, 2011. Telephone interviews were supplemented with a
self-administrated mail-back and web survey component, which was sent to a
considerable proportion of respondents of the first part of the study. The
fielding period for the self-administered interview parts ended on December
12, 2011. The sample is meant to be representative of all Swiss citizens
residing in Switzerland who were at least 18 years old at the beginning of
October 2011. 

The Swiss Federal Statistical Office randomly drew the sample, based on a
sampling frame that includes all individuals (not households) resident in
Switzerland. Thus, individuals were the primary sampling unit. While the
sampling frame provides information on respondents' address, marital status,
age and sex, telephone numbers were only listed for about two-thirds of the
selected addresses. To obtain telephone numbers for the remaining
individuals, collaborators considered other databases and searched for them
manually. Additionally, a 20CHF incentive was sent to those individuals for
whom a phone number could not be found, asking them to provide a phone
number where they could be reached. 

Nevertheless, for 15% of the initially sampled persons, no phone number
could be matched to the sampling frame. Therefore, these persons could not
be interviewed. This number is close to other estimates of households
without a registered landline and/ or mobile phone. Furthermore, Swiss
voters living abroad were excluded from the sampling frame (another 2,6% of
the total eligible population). 

The sample size was stratified to include a minimum of 100 respondents per
canton in each of the 26 cantons and to have at least 600 respondents in the
cantons of Zurich, Geneva, and Tessin. Prior to the study, a letter was sent

The sampling of the other respondents was realized by a probability
proportional to size (PPS) three-stage systematic sampling. In the first
stage, legislative constituencies were sampled according to six major
geographic regions. In the second stage, urban villages (li) or rural
villages (cun) were selected as sampling units. Finally, respondents were
selected from household registration data provided by the Ministry of the

the King Prajadhipok's Institute and started on July 3, 2011, the day of the
Thai general election 2011. Interviews were conducted in Thai, Malay and
Tribe language such as Lahu. The multi-stage systematic random sample is
meant to be representative of the eligible voting population of Thailand,
i.e. citizens aged 18 years or above who are registered to vote.

For this survey, the country was divided into five regions corresponding to
the four regions of Thailand plus Bangkok. For the first stage of sampling,
a list of Amphoe (districts) per region was randomly selected. These
districts were the primary sampling units. In the second stage, a number of
Tambol (subdistricts) were randomly selected within each Amphoe. The third
stage consisted in randomly selecting a number of villages within each
Tambol. The fourth stage of sampling determined the number of people to be
surveyed within a village. In each stage, the numbers of units to be sampled
within a geographic area were all chosen proportional to the size of the
population. In the final stage, individual respondents were systematically
sampled with information provided by the Community Department of the
Ministry of Interior. In Bangkok, a list of sub-districts was randomly
selected in the first stage. Afterward, systematic sampling was applied to
select individual respondents from voter lists, which were available for the
Bangkok region. After the interview, respondents received a book and a pen

The CSES Module was included in a post-election face-to-face survey which
was implemented between July 18 and September 10, 2015. Data collection was
realized by Frekans Arastirma and started 41 days after the Turkish general
election on June 7, 2015. Interviews were conducted in Turkish. The sample
is meant to be representative of the voting age population of Turkey living
in urban as well as rural areas – that is, Turkish citizens aged 18 years 
or older. Institutionalized persons and military personnel were excluded 
from the sample frame (about 1,59% of the total eligible population).

The sampling procedure started with the use of Turkish Statistical
Institute's (TUIK) NUTS-2 regions. The target sample was stratified
according to each region's share of urban and rural population given by the
Address-Based Population Registration System (ADNKS) records as of the end
of 2014. Next, TUIK's block data were used with block size set at 400
residents. Address blocks were the primary sampling unit. Twenty voters 
were targeted to be reached within each block, and no substitution was 
allowed. The probability proportionate to population size (PPPS) principle 
was used in distributing the blocks to NUT1 regions. For each of the 20 
addresses, up to three visits were carried out with the expectation that 
approximately 50% of the addresses would result in a completed interview. 
In rural areas where TUIK was unable to provide addresses, collaborators 
contacted the village's headman (muhtar) and selected 20 addresses in a 
systematic random sample from the list of households in the village. To 
select an individual within the sampled household, names of all reported 
individuals of 18 years or older were written on cards. Then, a person in
the household was asked to randomly select one card with the name of the 
individual to be interviewed. If for any reason that individual could not 
participate in the survey at the first visit, the same household was 
visited up to three times to obtain the interview. If the interview could
not be conducted after three trials, the respective household was dropped
from the sample without being substituted. However, respondents who were
reluctant to be interviewed were shown a letter containing information on
the collaborators, the nature of the project and collaborators' privacy
commitment. Overall, 1086 interviews  were completed.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The American National Election Study (ANES) 2012 Time Series has a
pre-post-election panel design in which respondents were interviewed twice:
once pre-election and once in a post-election survey. The study
features a dual-mode design combining the traditional ANES face-to-face
interviewing with a separate sample interviewed on the Internet. Although
the CSES was included in both modes, the sample provided here only consists
of face-to-face interviews, due to the low-response rate in the online
component. Post-election face-to-face interviews featuring the CSES module
were administered between November 7, 2012, and January 13, 2013, starting
the day after the U.S. presidential election on November 6, 2012. Data was
collected by Abt SRBI. The questionnaires were administered in English and
Spanish.

The sample is meant to be representative of U.S. citizens aged 18 or older
as of election day. Institutionalized persons, military personnel residing
in on-base housing, and the states of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded from
the sampling frame. The same holds for addresses where mail is not
delivered, as the sampling frame consisted of the Delivery Sequence File
(DSF) used by the United States Postal Service for the residential delivery
of mail. However, collaborators made further efforts to compensate this.

An address-based, stratified, multi-stage cluster sample in 125 census
tracts was used. In addition to a nationally-representative main sample,
there were two oversamples, one of blacks and one of Hispanics. The first
stage of the sampling involved stratifying the 48 contiguous states and the
District of Columbia into nine regions corresponding to Census Divisions.
These Census divisions constitute the study's strata. Within each region,
census tracts were then randomly selected, with the number of tracts being
proportional to the region's proportion of the U.S. adult population
(probability proportional to size). The second stage of sampling consisted
of the random selection of residential addresses from the DSF within each
tract. Addresses for the black and Hispanic oversamples were selected from
tracts with high proportions of one or both of these populations. The third
and final stage of sampling was the selection of one eligible person per
household. Screening was accomplished by sending an interviewer to the
sampled address and completing a brief interview in which eligible
respondents were listed. The interviewer's computer then randomly selected
one person from the list. No substitutions were acceptable.

Prior to the interview, respondents received an advance letter. Furthermore,
face-to-face respondents were offered money to complete the interview.
Depending on the level of pre-election incentivization, respondents were
initially offered $50 or $100. These amounts were increased to $75 and $125,
respectively, at the end of the field period. Additionally, eligible
respondents reluctant to participate were sent a customized letter
addressing their specific concern. For the face-to-face component, panel
attrition rate was 7%. The sample consists of 1929 completed interviews.

<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The American National Election Study includes a combined DEMOGRAPHIC AND 
SAMPLE WEIGHT. The weight is post-stratified to produce estimates that 
match known population proportions for age, race/ethnicity, educational 
attainment, martial status, income, census region, home ownership, 
nation of birth and cross-classifications of age and gender, and of 
race/ethnicity and educational attainment.
