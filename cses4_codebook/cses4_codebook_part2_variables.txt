))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 2: VARIABLES DESCRIPTION"
===========================================================================

Part 2 of the CSES Codebook provides users with information about the 
variables in the CSES dataset as well as accompanying information about
each polity's election study. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 4 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES Module 4 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "D" 
(D being the fourth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
Module 4).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programmes. 

In this part of the codebook (Part 2), the headers for individual variables
are surrounded by two lines of dashes. For e.g.: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAME                  VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

For further details on the CSES Module 4 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

>>> VARIABLE NOTES

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polity's for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES Codebook. 

>>> ELECTION STUDY NOTES

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of ELECTION STUDY NOTES. 
They are notes which are attached to each variable included in the dataset
and refer to case-specific information regarding a particular variable. 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. They are also used to provide source data information for 
users. Where applicable, ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed below a particular
variable and any VARIABLE NOTES in Part 2 and 3 of the CSES codebook. They
can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in
Parts 2-4 of the CSES Codebook.


===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 4 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and 
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding 
schemes. The details of each party leader classification is available in 
Part 3 of the CSES Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING 

All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. These codes are used to Identify the following: 
   - who a respondent's voted for in the current election (variable D3006). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (variable D3008).
   - the respondent's party identification (variable D3018).
   - the extent of institutional contact the respondent received from a 
     party/coalition during the election campaign (variable D3021).

The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely:  
   - which party/coalition held the presidency before and after the 
     elections (variable D5007 and D5011). 
   - which party/coalition held the prime ministership before and after 
     the elections (variable D5008 and D5012). 

Where possible, the numeric codes assigned to parties/coalitions are 
consistent for the current and previous election. However, for the previous
election (variable D3008) different codes might have been allocated for the
same parties (for example a party in the current election might be standing
as party of a coalition but previously stood alone). Users are advised to
consult the election study notes for variable D3008 for each country where
details of deviations are noted. 

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition 
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most votes
etc...         

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable D3011). 
   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable D3013).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
   - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral 
     district (variable D4003). 
   - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
     (variables D5001, D5002, & D5005).
   - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
     (variables D5003 & D5004).
   - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios 
     before and after the election (variable D5009 & D5013).
   - expert judgements by the national collaborators of the 
     said party/coalition's ideological family (variable D5016).
   - expert judgements by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable D5017).

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e.: Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B etc...)

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 
   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable D3012).

         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, variable D1006
         | (CSES polity code) and D1008 (election year).
         |
         | The first three characters are the alphabetic country codes
         | 'alpha-3' created by the International Organization for

         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as an underscore (_).

         | The Argentinian election survey was conducted in two waves.
         | Only the second wave of the survey is used for CSES. It 
         | contained 780 respondents which had been sampled initially
         | for the first survey as well as a refresh sample of 626

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


         | VARIABLE NOTES: D1010
         |
         | These variables report the original weights provided with
         | the respective deposited data files.
         |
         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics to more closely resemble the
         | characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         | official vote counts.
         |
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables. Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is unavailable, these
         | variables are coded 1.
         |
         | Collaborators provided the original weights with a varying
         | number of decimal places. In this CSES dataset, however, all
         | of the original weights have been rounded to four decimal
         | places at maximum (i.e. 1.1234) using STATA.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2015): D1010_2 & D1010_3
         |
         | The original weight for Finland 2015 is a combined weight that
         | corrects for both demographics (mother tongue, age, and gender)
         | as well as the overall national election results. Hence, this
         | weight was used to code both the demographical weight (D1010_2)
         | as well as the political weight (D1010_3). Thus, applying
         | either one of the two will result in the same adjustments of the
         | analyses.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2012): D1010_2 & D1010_3

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2013): D1010_1 & D1010_2
         |
         | The sample weight is intended to correct for the oversampling of
         | respondents in East Germany and distribution of household sizes.
         | The demographic weight adjusts for education, age, gender and
         | "BIK--Gemeindegroessenklassen" (size of communities). 
         | Furthermore, the original data contained 19 ineligible cases,
         | which were removed from the CSES published dataset without
         | any adjusting of the weight variables.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (2015): D1010_1 & D1010_2
         | 
         | The sample weight corrects for unequal selection probabilities
         | due to the separate numbers of dwellings, typically flats within
         | Postcode Address Files (PAF), or multiple households in 
         | dwellings or multiple eligible persons within households. The 
         | weight is constructed as the inverse of the person's chance 
         | within a household to be interviewed. The selection weight is 
         | 'capped' at five to minimize its negative impact on the standard
         | error and then rescaled to arrive at the original sample size.
         | The demographic weight accounts for differing levels of response
         | from different groups. It corrects for age, gender and region.
         | The demographic weight was calculated after the selection weight
         | had been applied. For more information, see the design report.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2012): D1010_2

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2012): D1010_2
         |
         | The weight variable was calculated on basis of age, sex
         | and respondents' level of education. For 103 respondents, age is
         | unknown. These cases are assigned the average original weight

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2011): D1010_2 & D1010_3
         |
         | Two different weights are provided. The demographic weight 
         | ensures that the data is representative of the Irish population 
         | in terms of age, gender, and social class. The political weight
         | is a combined weight, that takes into account the demographic
         | weight and, in addition, adjusts the data so that the
         | distribution of the reported vote choice matches the official  
         | results from the 2011 Irish election.  
 
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2013): D1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight is constructed to take into account the

         | conform to the known population distributions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - KENYA (2013): D1010_1
         |
         | The provided sample weight adjusts for varying probabilities of
         | selection due to oversampling of various constituencies. The 
         | weight was constructed based on provinces and matches the  
         | population by region and the urban-rural population 
         | distribution.       

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LATVIA (2011): D1010_1 & D1010_2
         |
         | There is one weighting variable for the Latvian election study, 
         | which combines both correction for unequal probabilities of 
         | selection (sample weights) and demographic weights. Criteria 
         | that were used for the data weighting are age, nationality, 
         | region, type of residence and gender.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LATVIA (2014): D1010_2
         |         
         | The demographic weight's aim is to get the sample division as
         | close as possible to the universe. Criteria that were used for
         | the data weighting are: age, nationality, region, type of
         | residence and gender.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2012): D1010_1 & D1010_2

         | The sample design weight is a means of correcting for
         | non-response.
         |
         | The demographic weight is s constructed to take into account the
         | distributions of age and gender in order to conform to the
         | known population distributions.
         |
         | This raw weight is not centered around '1' (rather the mean
         | weight is approximately 32,000) and while the weight ratios are
         | correct, using the weight will alter the weighted case counts
         | accordingly.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2015): D1010_2
         |
         | The combined weight corrects for unequal probabilities of the
         | sampling units. Post-stratification weights were estimated to
         | correct for non-response and to match known demographic
         | characteristics of the populations' gender and age, based on
         | census data from 2010.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2012): D1010_2
         |
         | The weights variable was calculated on the base of
         | respondents' ratio of ethnicity, age and gender to the
         | Montenegrin population.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2011): D1010_2 & D1010_3
         |
         | The demographic weight adjusts from real income distribution of
         | the sample (D2020) to exact quintiles.
         | The political weight adjusts for party vote and turnout,
         | on top of the income weight. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2014): D1010_2 & D1010_3
         |
         | The demographic weight adjusts for age groups and education.
         | The political weight adjusts for voting and non-voting according
         | to the official data on top of the demographic weight.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2013): D1010_2
         |
         | The provided weight adjusts for non-response in the survey 
         | which correlated particular demographic characteristics. The
         | weight adjusts for individual turnout (controlled against 
         | electoral roll), gender, age, and education.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2016): D1010_1-D1010_3
         |
         | The sample and demographic weights (D1010_1 and D1010_2) are 
         | equal. They both contain design weights accounting for unequal
         | probabilities of selection, combined with demographic weights 
         | based on the population distribution of age and gender. 
         | The political weight (D1010_3) combines the design weights with
         | political weights based on the results of the first presidential
         | election round. Political weights were not constructed for 123
         | respondents. 105 of these respondents did not cast a vote in the
         | presidential elections (D3005_PR_1) and the other 18 respondents
         | did not specify their vote choice in the presidential elections
         | (D3006_PR_1). These cases were recoded to 0 for the political
         | weight variable and thus, are dropped from analyses if D1010_3
         | is applied.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PHILIPPINES (2016): D1010_1
         |
         | The sample is equally allocated across the four major areas
         | (National Capital Region, the rest of Luzon outside the NCR,
         | Visayas and Mindanao. A census-based population weight corrects
         | for the different probability to be sampled due to the known
         | allocation of the population in these areas. Also more details
         | see the design report of the study.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2015): D1010_2
         |
         | The provided weight was designed to match the sample with known
         | demographic characteristics of the population, namely region, 
         | gender, age and education. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2012): D1010_1-D1010_3
         |
         | The sample weight corrects for the variance in the probability 
         | of being selected into the sample. The demographic weight is
         | designed to match known characteristics in the population 
         | (gender and age) and further accounts for residence  
         | (urban/rural) and region (Transylvania, Muntenia, Moldavia, and
         | Bucharest). The political weight corrects for discrepancies 
         | between the reported vote choice and the actual election 
         | results. The demographic and the political weight are 
         | cumulative weights, that is, the demographic weights also takes
         | into account the sample weight and the political weight takes 
         | into account both the sample and the demographic weight. The
         | weights were created for each of the two sample components 
         | separately (see D1007) and thus, can be applied when working 
         | with the full sample.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2014): D1010_1-D1010_3
         |
         | The sample weight corrects for the variance in the probability 
         | of being selected into the sample. These probabilities differ
         | because polls differ in their size. The demographic weight
         | was computed after the sample weight was applied and is designed
         | to match known demographic characteristics in the voting 
         | population (gender, age categories, urban/rural residence
         | and eight regions). The political weight was computed after
         | both the sample and the demographic weights were applied. It
         | corrects the sample to match the official election results
         | at the national level for both Presidential Election rounds
         | simultaneously.  
 
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SERBIA (2012): D1010_1 & D1010_2
         |
         | The sample weight corrects for over-sampling and different
         | household size.
         | The demographic weight corrects for differential non-response
         | according to urbanization level (and includes the sampling
         | weight).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SLOVAKIA (2016): D1010_2

         | and total people over the age of 18.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2011): D1010_1 & D1010_3
         |
         | The sample weight controls for oversampling of citizens by
         | cantons in the telephone interviews, and is calculated in line
         | with known population distributions from Swiss Statistics.
         | The political weight controls for the overall turnout and the
         | vote share of parties, multiplied with the sample weight.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2012): D1010_2

         | The provided weight allows to generalize from the sample to the 
         | general population of eligible voters in the 2012 presidential
         | election. The weight accounts for gender, age (5 groups),
         | education (5 groups), and area (6 regions). The weight was 
         | created, using the raking method.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2011): D1010_1

         | used to create the derivative "Polity Weights" in variables
         | D1012_1 through D1012_3.
         |
         | To follow is the STATA code used to create variables
         | D1011_1, D1011_2, and D1011_3:

         |     replace D1011_`i' = r(mean) if D1004=="`x'"
         |   }

         |
         | The STATA code to create the derivative variables in the CSES
         | dataset was run on the original, unrounded version of
         | the original weight variables (D1010_1-D1010_3). Thereafter
         | the derivative variables were rounded to four decimal places at
         | maximum (i.e. 1.1234) using STATA.
         |
         | It is due to this rounding that the mean values of derivative
         | weight variables D1011_1-D1011_3 for individual election studies
         | and for the full dataset are close to, but not necessarily

         | These variables report standardized versions (with a mean 1
         | within the polity) of the original weights provided with the
         | component election studies, described in D1010. They are the
         | ratio of each weighting factor to the mean weight (D1011) of
         | each type, calculated within each polity.
         |
         | The derivative "Polity Weight" (D1012) has been created so
         | that for each weight (sample, demographic, political), each
         | respondent within the election study has a mean weight of "1".
         | If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         | study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         | individual weight for each respondent within an election
         | study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         | election study.
         |
         | To follow is the STATA code used to create variables
         | D1012_1, D1012_2, and D1012_3:

         |
         | This variable reports the ratio of the average sample size to
         | each election study sample. Note that this factor is calculated
         | on the basis of the samples appearing in the CSES data files
         | (i.e. does not incorporate booster samples, panel respondents
         | who did not participate in the CSES wave of multi-wave studies,
         | etc.). Further, this factor treats elections, and not political
         | systems, as the unit of analysis. Analysts wishing to compare
         | across-countries, instead of a cross-election studies, should
         | adjust this weight accordingly.
         |
         | The resulting factor is then used to create the derivative
         | "Dataset Weights" in variables D1014_1 through D1014_3.
         |
         | To follow is the STATA code used to create variable D1013:
         |
         | gen n=1
         | gen tot_obs  = _N                /*Number of observations*/
         | gen estudies = _S                /*Number of election studies*/
         | gen mean_res = tot_obs/estudies

         | }
         |
         | replace D1013 =  mean_res / n_cases
         | drop n-Ncases
         |
         | The STATA code to create the derivative variables in the CSES
         | dataset was run on the original, unrounded version of
         | the original weight variables (D1010_1-D1010_3). Thereafter
         | the derivative variables were rounded to four decimal places at
         | maximum (i.e. 1.1234) using STATA.
         |
         | It is due to this rounding that the mean value of derivative
         | weight variable D1013 for the full dataset is close
         | to, but not necessarily exactly equal to, 1.0000.

         | These variables are intended for micro-level analyses involving

         | analysis, regardless of the original sample size. Users are
         | advised to read the notes of the preceding variables carefully
         | so as to ensure that their analyses will be weighted

         | The elections to renew the mandate for the House of Councilors,
         | the Upper House of the Japanese Parliament, were held on
         | July 21, 2013. Representatives elected to the House of
         | Councilors serve a fixed term of 6 years each, with elections
         | held every 3 years (usually in July) to renew the mandate of
         | half the members of the House. As these elections are held on a
         | fixed term basis, unlike the Japanese Lower House, which
         | although has a 4 year term early elections are frequent
         | (for e.g.: since WWII, there have been 26 lower House elections,
         | of which 25 were a result of early dissolution). Accordingly,
         | the CSES questionnaires (Modules 1-4) have been consistently
         | included in surveys focusing on the Upper House elections.

         | The 2013 Australian Election Study was conducted as a mixed-mode
         | survey. Approximately 85% of the sample was collected via self-
         | administered questionnaires through mail-back. The remaining 15%
         | of the sample completed the same survey online.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CANADA (2011 & 2015): D1023
         | The Canadian Election Study distributed the questions for the
         | CSES among three different survey components with different
         | survey modes. The first component, the campaign period survey
         | (CPS), which was fielded pre-election, and the second component,
         | the post-election survey (PES) were conducted as phone surveys.
         | The third component was conducted as a mail-back survey (MBS).
         | All components were fielded with the same sample of respondents
         | but note that there were drop-outs between the components. For 
         | further reference, please consult the 2011 and 2015 Canadian
         | Design Report. Wherever possible the post-election phone survey
         | was used for the CSES variables. For variables, in which this is
         | not the case, there is a reference in the election study notes,
         | which refers to the respective other survey part.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2015): D1023
         |
         | The first part of the study was conducted face-to-face.
         | Respondents were then offered a drop-off questionnaire. This
         | questionnaire included the following set of questions from the
         | CSES Module 4: D3019, D3020_, D3021_, D3022, D3023_, D3024,
         | D3027_, and D3028_. Of the 1,587 respondents who were initially 
         | interviewed, 684 returned the drop-off questionnaire. All
         | respondents who did not return the drop-off questionnaire were
         | coded as missing for the respective variables (See also election
         | study notes for all of the listed variables). Analysts can
         | distinguish between those respondents who returned the drop-off
         | questionnaire and those who did not, using variable D1007. For
         | further information, see election study note for D1007.

         | of the potential respondents provided an email address and
         | were asked to complete the survey on the web, with 529 persons
         | completing the interview in that fashion. The remaining
         | potential respondents - those which did not provide an email
         | address - were approached to complete the survey via
         | face-to-face interviewing.

         | post-election survey, administered via phone was fielded between
         | May 3 and July 5, 2011. The third component of the survey was 
         | administered via mail. The data for the dates on which the

         | voted early. Respondents who affirmed this were asked the
         | questions about their vote behavior (D3005_PR_1-D3006_UH_DC)

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2012): D2001_Y
         |
         | Respondents were not asked their year and month of birth, but 
         | their age. The variable represents the calculated year of birth,
         | using the year of the interview and the age of the respondent.
         | For persons whose birthday was only after the interview, the
         | year of birth will hence be incorrect.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2013): D2001_M
         |
         | For 137 respondents, the month of birth is missing.
         | The reason for this is unknown. Furthermore, the eligibility
         | of two respondents born in 1995 is unknown because the day and
         | month of birth are missing.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (2015): D2001_Y
         |
         |The British Election Study asked for age rather than Month/Year
         |of birth. D2001_Y is approximated by subtracting the respondents'
         |age from 2015.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2013): D2001_Y
         |
         | Respondents must be 20 years or older to be included in the
         | Japanese election study.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - KENYA (2013): D2001_Y
         |
         | The year of birth of a respondent was calculated based on 
         | the responses to a question in the original questionnaire 
         | reading 'How old were you at the time of your last birthday?'.
         | The year of birth was calculated by subtracting a respondent's
         | age from the election year (2013). Lacking information on the
         | month of birth, the year of birth thus calculated is only an
         | approximation and possibly diverges by one year from a
         | respondent's real year of birth. Furthermore, lacking the month
         | of birth of a respondent, we cannot be completely sure
         | about a respondents age at the time of the elections. We can
         | therefore not ensure that all respondents really were of voting
         | age at that time of the elections.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2012): D2001_Y
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in Montenegro is 18 years of

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2013): D2001_Y
         |
         | Respondents' age was asked instead of date of birth. The year of
         | birth was calculated by subtracting the age of respondent
         | from 2013, the year in which most of the interviews took place. 
         | Interviews took place between September 12, 2013 and January 
         | 6, 2014. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH AFRICA (2014): D2001_Y
         |
         | Respondents were not asked for their birthday, but for their
         | age. We calculated the year of birth with age. We used the 
         | year 2014 to subtract the age of respondent from, because it
         | can be assumed that most respondents would not have had 
         | birthday within the one to two months until their day of 
         | interview in 2015 took place. For respondents who did in fact
         | already have their birthday until their day of interview, the
         | year of birth will be miscalculated by one year.

         | The German education system transferability to
         | ISCED-2011 on the basis of the available data involves some
         | caveats which are detailed below.
         | Vocational training in Germany is usually undertaken by people
         | aged 16-19, having completed ten years of schooling. Respondents
         | who  obtained a secondary school leaving certificate at the 10th
         | grade, followed by 2-3 years of vocational training as well as
         | respondents who stayed in school 12-13 years and left school for
         | tertiary education are coded to CSES code 5 ("Upper
         | secondary schooling and vocational training") which corresponds
         | to ISCED-level 4. Meanwhile, respondents who completed full
         | secondary school schooling and vocational training are
         | coded to CSES code 6 ("Vocational training at a specialized
         | vocational institution") which corresponds to ISCED-level 5.

         | In the original questionnaire respondents were asked two 
         | questions in respect of their educational attainment. First, 
         | they were asked about the education level they had finished and
         | second about the education level they had not finished. Those
         | answers to these two questions are used to construct D2003.
         | Due to an error that arose during the data gathering process,
         | all university graduates are coded as "07. ISCED LEVEL 6 - 
         | BACHELOR OR EQUIVALENT" and no further distinction between

         | from the conventional ISCED standards and does not make the 
         | differentiation of incomplete and complete levels of education 
         | as in the Korean culture, the level of education is regarded 
         | as a confidential matter for interviewees and it is difficult to
         | illicit more detailed information of respondents beyond asking 
         | what level of education were the subject to. Thus the South
         | Korean distribution corresponds to the following answer

         | labor force in D2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses

         | socio economic status (D2012) and the industrial sector (D2014)

         | information from another question was used to determine whether
         | the respondent was working full-time, or less than that. The 
         | exact amount of hours could not be extracted. Rather, the

         | which in the CSES is 15 to less than 32 hours weekly. We
         | created a new category of 11 for individuals who responded
         | that they are currently working for pay, but when asked whether

         | VARIABLE NOTES: D2011
         |
         | This variable reports the respondent's main occupation; that
         | is, the job at which the respondent spends the most time or
         | if the respondent spends an equal amount of time on two jobs,
         | it is the one from which the respondent earns the most money.
         | For respondents who are currently employed, this variable
         | reports their current occupation. For respondents who are
         | retired or not currently working, this variable reports
         | respondent's last occupation.
         |
         | Coding conventions employ the first three-digits of 2008
         | ISCO / ILO International Standard Classification of Occupations
         | Code from the International Labor Office, CH-1211, Geneva 22,
         | Switzerland.
         |
         | In some cases it has not been possible to strictly adhere to the
         | ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some categories have
         | been added to the ISCO/ILO list in order to accommodate the
         | occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | Please refer to specific Election Study Notes for clarification
         | of additional codes.

         | Retired or unemployed respondents should answer the question
         | according to their previous occupation. Only those who
         | had never been in labor force should not be asked questions
         | related to occupation.
         | The occupation data provided was coded using the Australian and
         | New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) 
         | schema which does not have a direct, one-to-one, code 
         | correspondence  with the International Standard Classification 
         | of Occupations (ISCO). As such, there is only a partial and
         | approximate match between the two. For this reason, at the time
         | of this release, there are 431 cases which have been coded as
         | "996. OTHER OR NON-CLASSIFIABLE OCCUPATIONS".

         | The categories are intended to distinguish among the following
         | groups:
         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers,
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Includes, for example entrepreneurs, shop keeper,
         | professionals like lawyers, medical doctors etc.

         | Note that there is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (D2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (D2012-D2014). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in D2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | Retired or unemployed respondents should answer the
         | question according to their previous socio-economic status. Only
         | those who had never been in labor force should skip the
         | questions related to occupation.
         | The Australian questionnaire did not specifically ask
         | if the socio-economic status of respondents is either 'worker'
         | or 'farmer'. This information was extrapolated based on the
         | occupational codes of each respondents and the Australian
         | categorization of what groups are either 'white collar' or
         | 'blue collar'.

         | Additionally, those who were identified as self-employed in a
         | previous question (see notes to D2010) were coded as 4, and
         | those who were identified as farmers or agricultural workers in
         | D2011 were coded as 3. The variable includes socio-economic
         | status of respondents' last occupations, if currently out of

         | For respondent's who indicated to be 'retired' or 'looking for

         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (D2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (D2012-D2014). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | the labor force in D2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables
         | may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in the
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last
         | occupation.

         | In some cases, respondents who indicated to not be employed in
         | D2010 still answered item D2013. However, as many unemployed 
         | respondents did not answer D2013, it remains unclear whether 
         | those values refer to former occupation. One reason for the 
         | high number of missings is likely that respondents running 
         | their own subsistence farms did not think of it as a firm and 
         | thus did not answer this question.

         | Note that there is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | responses to the questions about current employment status
         | of spouses (D2015) were administered, affecting the application
         | of the follow-up occupation variables (D2017-D2019). The CSES
         | standard is that the occupation variables are asked for those in
         | the labor force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized
         | as not in the labor force in D2015 (codes 6-12), the occupation
         | variables may report their previous or last occupation.
         |
         | There is variation in the manner in which the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in D2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other responses could also lead to a
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently D2015
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents
         | who reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (D2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         | The Austrian questionnaire employed an initial

         | "currently employed or seeking work?". If respondent answered
         | "yes", the follow-up questions on the employment status (D2015),
         | the main occupation (D2016), the socio economic status (D2017)
         | and the industrial sector (D2019) were asked. Otherwise, these
         | follow-up questions were skipped in the interviewing.

         | They were given the chance to answer with "Don't have a spouse"
         | and if so, were coded as missing.
         | The response categories for the Brazilian questionnaire did not 
         | include hours worked. The questionnaire also included more 
         | categories than the CSES answer options. In the Brazilian study, 
         | this question was also asked to respondents with a partner.
         | Thus, we recoded the "Don't have a partner" response option as

         | VARIABLE NOTES: D2016
         |
         | (1) This variable reports the respondent's spouse's main
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's
         | spouse spends most of the time, or if the respondent's
         | spouse spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is
         | the one from which the respondent's spouse earns the most
         | money. For spouses who are currently employed, this variable
         | reports their current occupation. For spouses who are retired
         | or not currently working, this variable reports the spouse's
         | last occupation.
         |
         | (2) Coding conventions employ the first two-digits of 2008
         | ISCO / ILO International Standard Classification of
         | Occupations Code from the International Labor Office, CH-1211,
         | Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | In some cases it has not been possible to strictly adhere to the
         | ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some categories have
         | been added to the ISCO/ILO list in order to accommodate the
         | occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | Please refer to specific Election Study Notes for clarification
         | of additional codes.

         |
         | There is variation in the ways in which the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in D2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other responses could also lead to a
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently D2016
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (D2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         | Respondents who have a retired or unemployed partner should
         | answer the question according to the previous occupation of the
         | spouse. Only those whose partner had never been in labor force
         | should not be asked this question.
         | The occupation data provided was coded using the Australian and
         | New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO)
         | schema, which does not have a direct, on-to-one correspondence
         | with ISCO-08. As such, there is only a partial and approximate
         | match between the two. Consequently, there are 357 cases which
         | have been coded as "996. OTHER OR NON-CLASSIFIABLE OCCUPATIONS"
         | no corresponding match between ANZSCO and ISCO-08 could be
         | identified.

         | is that the occupation variables are asked from those in the 
         | labor force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as
         | not in labor force in D2015 (codes 6-12), the occupation 
         | variables may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the 
         | responses concerning occupation that belong to respondents not

         | questions, while in some surveys other responses could also lead
         | to a respondent being asked these questions. Consequently D2017

         |
         | Note that there is some inconsistency among studies in the
         | way the responses to the questions about current employment
         | status of souses (D2015) affected the application of the follow-
         | up occupation variables (D2017-D2019). The CSES standard is that
         | the occupation variables are asked from those in the labor
         | force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as not in
         | labor force in D2015 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |
         | Data on D2019 for spouses out of labor force are available
         | for ARGENTINA (2015), BRAZIL (2014), CZECH REPUBLIC (2013),

         |
         | See also notes for D2015.
         |
         | Moreover, there is variation in the ways in which the questions
         | about respondent's spouse were administered in different
         | election studies. In some cases only those categorized as
         | "married or living together" in D2004 were asked the spouse
         | questions, while in some surveys other responses could also lead
         | to a respondent being asked these questions. Consequently D2019
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (D2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         | Income ranges shown represent sample quintiles (not population 
         | quintiles).
         |
         | Where data were deposited in this format, income ranges shown 
         | are as originally reported by collaborators including gaps 
         | between contiguous sets of ranges.
         |
         | Where deposited income data were not grouped into sample 
         | quintiles, the data have been recoded into quintiles, according
         | to sample proportions (not national statistics). For cases where
         | it was not possible to compute sample quintiles, the income 
         | categories approximating sample quintiles the closest have been
         | used. Consequently, this variable may contain distributions that
         | do not really represent quintiles.
         |
         | Depending on how the income data was deposited, the variable 
         | reports either monthly or annual income. The table below shows 
         | which of the two applies to the election studies:

         | Japanese. In many homes, especially in country side, people have
         | their own small Buddhist temple, or small Shinto altar. These
         | are the targets of their daily religious practice, even they are

         | In the American National Election Study, respondents' 
         | first three mentions of their race were registered. CSES
         | notes only the first mention.
         | The category Hispanic was not presented in the same item as the 
         | rest of the categories. CSES used the item asking whether a
         | respondent is 'Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino' only to replace 
         | otherwise 'missing', 'refused' or 'other' codes.

         | This variable reports the electoral districts for the US lower
         | house elections, the House of Representatives. The first two
         | digits of the district codes indicate the federal state (US-
         | FIPS-code as used in D2027).
         | However, the district data for CSES Module 4 was collected for 
         | the US Presidential Election. Considering that the United
         | States uses an electoral college system that operates on the US
         | state level, the data was collected accordingly. To link the
         | district data to respondents in the CSES dataset, users should
         | make use of the variable D2028 (REGION OF RESIDENCE) which, in
         | the case of the US 2012 Elections, corresponds to the US states.

         |
         | The variable is from the pre-election survey. The standard CSES
         | category "996. WAS BORN IN COUNTRY" was not an answer option in
         | the study.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2013): D2034
         |
         | This variable only contains respondents who reported not being
         | born in Germany.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2012): D2034
         |
         | Of the 992 missing cases, 991 respondents were actually born in
         | Greece.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2012): D2034
         |
         | The variable was calculated basing on answers to the question 
         | for how many years respondents had been living in Hong Kong, in
         | 2012. One respondent, who answered more than 80 years is coded 
         | as 1931. This could be an underestimation. 
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ISRAEL (2013): D2034
         | 
         | Seven respondents reported a year of arrival prior to their year
         | of birth, as in D2001_Y. The data remained unchanged. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2012): D2034
         |
         | Fifty-two respondents reported that they are native-born
         | citizens in D2033 but then provided a "year of
         | arrival in the country" in question D2034. Those might be
         | persons who have either lived abroad for a couple of years (or
         | in some of the former Yugoslavian republics which are now
         | considered abroad) and they returned after the dissolution of
         | Yugoslavia or for some other reason. Namely, there were
         | Montenegrins born in Serbia at the time it was one country.
         | Two respondents reported a year of arrival which was earlier 
         | than their year of birth, as in D2001_Y.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2011): D2034
         |
         | Every respondent is a native Thai, so D2034 is missing. The
         | election study team of Thailand asked, however, when respondents
         | arrived in their current province.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2012): D2034
         |
         | The ANES includes an item asking in which time period a
         | respondent arrived in the U.S. by specifying four different
         | period, namely: 'before 1970', '1970-1989', '1990-1999', and
         | '2000-2012'. Analysts interested in these data are advised
         | to refer to the American National Election Study - available.

         | study containing similar items about specific aspects of the

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2015): D3001_
         |
         | The question text used in the Mexican questionnaire
         | deviated slightly from the standard CSES question
         | in that the reminder note included in the CSES 
         | question text "Remember if you say "more" it could require a tax 
         | increase, and if you say "less" it could require a reduction in 
         | those services." Was provided to respondents three times: in the
         | main question text before item D3001_1, between item D3001_3 and

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2015): D3001_3

         | The answer to the item "unemployment benefits" was formulated in 
         | the following way: "Support programs for unemployed to find 
         | work". This deviates somewhat from the concept used by the CSES
         | and described in the questionnaire: "The phrase "unemployment 
         | benefits" is intended to refer to public expenditure related to 
         | the unemployed, mainly through employment insurance programs,

         | question, reading: "Please indicate to what extent you Disagree
         | or Agree with this statement; 'Over the next ten years or so,
         | my family and I have a good chance of improving our standard of
         | living".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2012): D3003_
         |
         | There are some inconsistencies for the variables D3003_ in 
         | Montenegro 2012 study. There are 48 respondents who said that
         | the economy got worse on variable D3003_1 and answered question
         | D3003_2, and 4 respondents who said economy got better on 
         | variable D3003_1 and answered question D3003_3. The survey was 
         | conducted using the PAPI (pen and paper interviewing)
         | technique, and these inconsistencies were noticed after the data

         | The elections were general elections in which, amongst others, 
         | the president and the lower and upper house of the parliament 
         | were elected. When respondents indicated that they had voted in 
         | the general elections, it is assumed that they voted for all
         | of these three institutions. This assumption is supported by the
         | fact that the number of votes cast for the presidential, the
         | upper house and the lower house elections are very similar

         | cast a vote. Did you vote, not manage to vote, or choose not to
         | vote?' The answers 'did not manage to vote' and 'chose not to
         | vote' were collapsed into CSES category 'did not cast a ballot".
         | Both validated and unvalidated respondents data was provided.
         | The CSES makes use only of the unvalidated answers. Around 10%
         | of the answers did not match the validated answers with a larger
         | amount of persons underreporting their vote cast.

         | Because voting is compulsory in Australia, a question about

         | The question if respondents voted in the "first round" of the
         | current election did not differentiate between the
         | presidential, lower house and upper house elections. Since
         | voting is compulsory, it can be assumed, that most persons who
         | answered "yes", voted in all of the elections and those who
         | answered "no" did not vote in any of the elections, which took
         | place simultaneously. Furthermore, there were different kind of
         | "no" answers in the original dataset which showed why
         | respondents did not vote. These values were recoded as follows:

D3006_LH_PF >>> Q05LHd. CURRENT LOWER HOUSE ELECTION: DID RESPONDENT
                        CAST A PREFERENCE VOTE?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This variable reports whether a respondent cast a 
         preference vote. 
         
         There are two different types of preference vote. The first is
         associated with open PR-List systems. These systems allow citizens 
         to vote for a party list and to mark a "preference" for 
         one or more candidates within the party list. In these systems,
         this type of vote is known as a preference vote (or a candidate 
         vote). The second is associated with STV and AV 
         systems, where citizens rank-order candidates in descending 
         order of their preference. In these systems, a distinction is made 
         between a voter's first preference (i.e.: who voters allocate 
         their "number 1" preference to) and their subsequent lower 
         preferences. These latter preferences (i.e.: all the voter's 
         preferences aside from their first preference) are also known 
         as preference votes. We distinguish between these two different 
         types of preference votes in the below categorization. 

         In party list systems, the question asked of respondents should 
         read like this: 
         "Did you simply vote for a party or did you also express a 
         candidate preference?"
         
         In party list systems where voters have to vote directly for a 
         candidate and cannot cast a vote for the party list only (e.g.: 
         Estonia, Finland, & Poland), the question asked of respondents 
         should read like this: 
         "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         candidate?"
         
         In STV/AV systems, the question asked of respondents should be 
         akin to this: 
         "Which of the parties/candidates did you give your 
         preference vote to?"
         or

         preference vote to?"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This variable reports whether a respondent cast a preference
         vote in the current Upper House elections. 
         
         There are two different types of preference vote. The first is
         associated with open PR-List systems. These systems allow citizens 
         to vote for a party list and to mark a "preference" for 
         one or more candidates within the party list. In these systems,
         this type of vote is known as a preference vote (or a candidate 
         vote). The second is associated with STV and AV 
         systems, where citizens rank-order candidates in descending 
         order of their preference. In these systems, a distinction is made 
         between a voter's first preference (i.e.: who voters allocate 
         their "number 1" preference to) and their subsequent lower 
         preferences. These latter preferences (i.e.: all the voter's 
         preferences aside from their first preference) are also known

         | which party you voted for then - or perhaps you didn't vote?'
         | Respondents who reported not having voted in 2010 were coded as
         | 5 and all those reporting a vote choice were coded as 1.
         | Respondents' candidate answers were coded into D3007_LH_DC.

         | "1. RESPONDENT CAST A BALLOT" if a vote choice was indicated for
         | variable D3008_PR_1. This variable was coded "5. RESPONDENT DID
         | NOT CAST A BALLOT" if variable D3008_PR_1 was missing. The
         | categories "refused" and "don't know" were also coded according
         | to D3008_PR_1.

         | vote." As a consequence, respondents who were ineligible to vote
         | in the 2008 elections, were coded as "did not cast a ballot."

         | seats are up for election every eight years with these two
         | possibilities alternating from election to election. In the 
         | 2014 Brazil election 1/3 of the Upper House seats were up for
         | election. Thus, voters could vote for one candidate only within
         | the federal state of residency. In 2010, however, voters could
         | vote for two candidates since 2/3 of the Upper House seats were
         | up for election. Consequence, the 2014 Brazilian Electoral
         | Study asked for whom voters voted with their first and second
         | choice in the 2010 Upper House election. These information are
         | reported in the two separate variables, D3008_UH_DC_1 and

D3010       >>> Q08. WHO PEOPLE VOTE FOR MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Q08. Some people say that no matter who people vote for, it won't
              make any difference to what happens. Others say that who
              people vote for can make a big difference to what happens.
              Using the scale on this card, (where ONE means that voting
              won't make any difference to what happens and FIVE means that
              voting can make a big difference), where would you place

         | Leaders and their alphabetical classifications for each country
         | are detailed in Part 3 of the CSES codebook. For more

         | please see Part 3 of the CSES codebook. 
         |
         | In some cases, leaders were assigned an alphabetical 
         | CSES code but data for D3012_ is not available for these 
         | leaders. These instances are documented in an election study
         | note below the party/leader table of the Election Study to 
         | which this applies in Part 3 of the CSES codebook. 
         |
         | Users should note that D3012_ includes several observations in 
         | which all parties are scored equally by respondents. Also, there
         | may be instances in which respondents provide the same answer to

         | The variable is from the pre-election survey. The question 
         | about LEADER D, Gilles Duceppe (BC), was only asked in Quebec,
         | the only Province Bloc Quebecois competed in. The original scale
         | of the variable ranged from 0 (Really Dislike) to 100 (Really 
         | Like). It was rescaled to the 11-point scheme by first dividing
         | it by 9.18. In a second step, decimal values were rounded        
         | upwards and downwards to match the integers from 0 to 10.
         | Further, there were different categories that respondents could
         | choose from to indicate that they did not know the leader they
         | were asked to rate, namely “Don’t know any of the leaders” and
         | “Don’t know who that leader is.” These were both recoded into 
         | the CSES category “96. HAVEN’T HEARD OF LEADER.”

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2013): D3012
         |
         | Though the CSES convention has been to only include one
         | personality per party, the German Election Study includes
         | two party personalities for several of the parties. However,
         | with the exception of the Social Democratic Party (SPD),
         | only one leader per party is included for Germany in the CSES.
         | The decision about which of the two politicians to include for
         | each party (except for the SPD) in the CSES is based on the
         | number of respondents that evaluated or were able to evaluate
         | the said candidates. The candidate that was evaluated by most
         | respondents was chosen for inclusion in the dataset.
         | Analysts who are interested in respondents' evaluation of the
         | other parties' leaders not included in the CSES data are
         | referred to the German Election Study data directly,
         | which can be accessed at: http://www.gles.eu/ (Date accessed:
         | May 16, 2018).

         |
         | Respondents were not asked what they thought about the Portugal
         | Ahead Coalition (PaF) but instead were asked to rate their 
         | like/dislike for each party comprising the Portugal Ahead 
         | Coalition (PaF). Accordingly, the like-dislike scores of the 
         | PPD-PSD leader, Pedro Passos Coelho, are coded into variable 
         | D3012_A while like-dislike scores of the CSD-PP leader, Paulo 
         | Portas, are coded into variable D3011_H.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2012): D3012_
         |
         | The Korean Election Study asked the like-dislike leader question
         | for several leaders of the two major parties New Frontier Party 
         | and Democratic United Party. The CSES chose one leader per 
         | party, namely Park Geun-hye (NFP) and Moon Jae-in (DUP). The
         | reason for selecting these two leaders was, that they ended up
         | running for president in the presidential elections in December
         | 2012. The Korean Election Study additionally asked this question
         | for other party leaders who were considered potential 
         | presidential candidates by the time the survey was conducted.

         |
         | The Green Party was led by two politicians, Gustav Fridolin and  
         | Asa Romson. Since CSES is limited to nine parties/candidates   
         | for all respective variables including party evaluation, we 
         | had to two choose among these two. We decided to include
         | Gustav Fridolin based on the higher share of respondents who  
         | evaluated him compared to the share who evaluated Romson.

         | Election Study suggests that this is a consequence of 
         | respondents having difficulty accurately placing these parties
         | on the left-right scale and that the expert judgments, based on
         | an expert survey conducted by the British Election Study prior

         | especially for parties D-H, which were placed to value zero by
         | higher percentages of voters. According to the primary 
         | researcher, biases could have multiple reasons - simple lack of
         | information, or confusion about the terms left and right which
         | had made more sense to people in the 1990s, because of their
         | stances vis a vis apartheid, and whether the country would move
         | towards socialism or liberal democracy. Greater confusion could
         | have arisen after president Thabo Mbeki attacked his opponents
         | as 'leftists'. Also a rather large percentages can't
         | make use of the scale, see D3014.

         | were first asked whether they sympathize with any political 
         | party (this was coded in D3028_1). If they answered "yes", they 
         | were asked which party this is. If they made several mentions,

         | bit more (this party was coded into D3018_3. For respondents who 
         | mentioned only one party, this party was coded into D3018_3. If 
         | they did not mention any party or had already said "no" to the
         | first question, they were asked whether there is any party that 
         | they sympathized a bit more with than the others (this was coded 
         | in D3018_2). If they answered "yes" here, they were asked which 
         | party this was (this party was coded into D3018_3).
         |
         | Furthermore, the wording of the question used in the Mexican 
         | questionnaire for D3018_1 deviates somewhat from that in the 
         | CSES questionnaire. It reads: "Independently of which party you

         | The data show that 60 respondents repeated their party
         | mentions. This is because in the original questionnaire, there
         | were separate answer options for having been contacted by a
         | candidate and a party. When transferring these answers to the
         | CSES format, these two answer options were recoded into one

         |
         | Respondents were asked to name a maximum of three
         | parties only. Hence, D3021_4 through D3021_10 are coded 
         | missing for all Slovak respondents. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2011): D3021_
         |
         | The questions about parties contacting respondents during the
         | electoral campaign were asked separately for each of the major
         | parties A through G, listed in Part 3 of the Codebook.
         | Consequently, D3021_1 through D3021_7 do not reflect any
         | preference order of respondent.
         | These questions were asked only in the mail-back and web survey
         | (see D1023).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2012): D3021_
         |
         | It seems like 272 respondents repeated their party
         | mentions. This is because in the original questionnaire there
         | were separate answer options for having been contacted by a
         | candidate and a party (e.g. 'Candidate - Democratic' and 'Party
         | - Democratic'). For transferring this to the CSES format, these
         | two were recoded into one category. Respondents with
         | repeated party mentions can thus be assumed to have indicated
         | that they were contacted by the candidate of a party as well as
         | by the party as such.

         Q18. During the campaign, did a friend, family member, neighbor,
              work colleague or other acquaintance try to persuade you to
              vote for a particular party or candidate?

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2013): D3022
         |
         | The Australian questionnaire did not include a filter question,
         | asking for institutional contact, in general. Instead,
         | respondents were asked about the type of contact, providing an
         | answer option "None". To process D3022, respondents who said
         | "None" were coded as '5. No', while respondents that mentioned
         | at least one of the type, listed in D3023_, were coded
         | '1. Yes'. All other respondents were coded '9. Missing' in
         | D3022.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CANADA (2011): D3022
         |
         | The variable is from the post-election mail-back survey. Also,
         | the question wording in the original survey deviated
         | from CSES conventions and read as follows: “During the campaign,
         | did a friend, family member, neighbor, work colleague or other
         | acquaintance contact you about voting for a particular party or
         | candidate?” Rather than the word “persuade”, the word “contact”
         | is used.

         | The original Kenyan dataset also includes information about the 
         |  means of communication (e.g. in person, telephone, email)
         | used by a personal contact (friend, family member etc.) to
         | persuade the respondent to vote for a particular party 
         | or candidate. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LATVIA (2011): D3022
         |
         | The question wording in the Latvian election study slightly
         | deviates from the CSES norm in that certain categories of
         | personal contacts were not explicitly mentioned. The Latvian 
         | question reads: Did your relative, friend or colleague try to 
         | persuade you to vote for a particular party during the pre-
         | election campaign?

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2011 & 2014): D3022
         |
         | The New Zealand Election Study did not ask the screening
         | question of whether respondent was contacted personally (D3019)
         | The variable reported here is constructed on the basis of the
         | responses to D3023_ questions. Respondents who answered
         | negatively to each of the contact modes (D3023_) were coded
         | "5. No" in D3022 (and missing in D3023_), and the remaining
         | respondents were coded "1. Yes" for F3022.

D3025_1_B   >>> Q20a. ORIGINAL POLITICAL INFORMATION ITEM - 1ST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The items in question set Q20a-Q20d are designed to indicate the
         respondent's general political awareness. Their intent is to
         provide a combined general assessment of the respondent's
         attention to politics, more than of their knowledge or familiarity
         with specific aspects of politics.

         For each question, please provide CSES the original question with
         the full response set, as provided to the respondent.
         Additionally, please let CSES know which answer is the "correct"
         answer out of the four choices provided to the respondent. In the
         variable provided to CSES, CSES wants to receive the actual answer
         that the respondent provided, not whether the answer was correct
         or not. If the order of the response codes was randomized, we
         would also appreciate receiving an additional variable indicating
         the randomization for each respondent.

         In Q20a, one name in the list should be the Finance Minister that
         was in office at the moment of the election. The three other names
         in the list should be three other high-profile Cabinet Ministers
         in that previous government.


         Q20a. Which of these persons was the Finance Minister before the
               recent election - [CABINET MINISTER NAME - FIRST CHOICE],
               [CABINET MINISTER NAME - SECOND CHOICE], [CABINET MINISTER
               NAME - THIRD CHOICE], or [CABINET MINISTER NAME - FOURTH

         |
         | This question was formulated slightly differently reading "Who
         | of the following is the finance minister?". As the Mexican
         | election study was conducted between 13 and 21 days after the 
         | elections, it is clear that no new cabinet had been formed yet 
         | and that this question, hence, refers to the finance minister 
         | before the elections.

         In the options, please list each of the unemployment rate choices
         in the format "XX.X%" - for instance, 4.5% or 10.1%.

         After populating one of the options with the actual current
         unemployment rate in the country of your election study,
         please then add or subtract 2.0% from that amount until the
         other three options are populated with incorrect
         alternatives.

         Please list the options in increasing order.

         For instance, if the actual unemployment rate is 8.7%, any of
         these example choice sets would be acceptable:

         2.7%, 4.7%, 6.7%, 8.7%
         4.7%, 6.7%, 8.7%, 10.7%
         6.7%, 8.7%, 10.7%, 12.7%
         8.7%, 10.7%, 12.7%, 14.7%

         In the question text where "[DATE]" appears, please provide the

         When depositing the election study with the CSES Secretariat, it
         would be helpful for the collaborator to let the CSES Secretariat
         know the source of the unemployment rate used in the question.

             2. [UNEMPLOYMENT RATE - 2ND CHOICE]
             3. [UNEMPLOYMENT RATE - 3RD CHOICE]

         | Retired respondents as well as those doing home duty
         | (codes 7 and 8 in D2010) were asked about how difficult it would
         | be to find another job within the next twelve month.

         | This question was also answered by some respondents
         | who are classified as not currently in the labor force,
         | according to D2010. This is because the skip pattern applied in
         | the American National Election Study (ANES) is based on a
         | slightly different definition of 'currently in the labor force'
         | than suggested in D2010. For example, respondents who indicated
         | to primarily be students but also indicated doing paid work at
         | the same time were also asked D3028_1.

D3028_2     >>> Q23b. FIND ANOTHER JOB - SPOUSE/PARTNER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         While this question is considered part of the CSES Module, to
         accommodate the aforementioned skip pattern, collaborators are
         asked to please place this question somewhere after their question
         indicating the "current employment status" of the respondent, a
         question which is normally included in the demographics section of
         a questionnaire.

         Q23b. If your spouse/partner lost their job, how easy or difficult
               would it be for them to find another job IN THE NEXT TWELVE
               MONTHS? Very easy, somewhat easy, somewhat difficult, or
               very difficult?

             1. VERY EASY
             2. SOMEWHAT EASY
             4. SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT
             5. VERY DIFFICULT

))) CSES MODULE 4 DISTRICT-LEVEL VARIABLES
===========================================================================

         | VARIABLE NOTES:
         |
         | (1) Respondents' electoral districts are reported in D2032,
         |     with labels listed in Part 4 of the Codebook.
         |
         | (2) According to the different types of elections included in
         |     this CSES release, the tables below provide an overview of 
         |     each polity and to which election the district data 
         |     pertains to and details the number of districts in total 
         |     In each state and the number of these districts which are 
         |     sampled by studies included in CSES. Users are advised to 
         |     consult these tables carefully to decide which data is 
         |     appropriate for their analyses. 
         |
         | (3) In mixed systems, such as Germany or New Zealand, district 
         |     data refers to the constituency vote (as opposed to the 
         |     list-PR vote).
         |
         | (4) There are two versions of each district-level variable. 
         |     Most election studies are coded into D4001-D4005. For 
         |     polities that operate one nationwide electoral district,
         |     district data are coded into variables D4001_N-D4005_N 
         |     to specifically highlight one nationwide district polities.

         |
         | The data represents the first electoral tier (regionalwahl 
         | kreis). Seats in Austria are distributed across three tiers 
         | (regionalwahlkreis-tier 1; landwahlkreis-tier 2; and the  
         | federal level-tier 3). To win seats (the constituencies at the 
         | regionalwahlkreis are multi-seat constituencies), a party
         | must reach a quota(s). The quota is calculated by dividing 
         | the number of valid votes cast in the landwahlkreis (tier 2) 
         | that the said regionalwahlkreis is in, by the number of seats 
         | allocated to the landwahlkreis (tier 2) in total. If no party 
         | surpasses this quota, no seat is allocated at tier 1 and these
         | votes go into the mix in deciding allocation of seats at 
         | the landwahlkreis (tier 2). In 2013, no seats were allocated 
         | in the following regionalwahlkreis because no party reached the 
         | necessary quota to guarantee a seat: 
         |         Western Corinithia (District No. 00005 for Austria)
         |         Salzburg City      (District No. 00019 for Austria)

         | D4001 reports the number of electoral college votes
         | allocated to each state in the US Presidential election and not
         | the number of congressional seats in each district.
         | Considering that the United States uses an electoral college 
         | system that operates on the state level, the data was collected
         | accordingly. Variable D2032 links the respondent with the 
         | lower house district that they voted in. Variable D2028 details
         | the Region of Residency which corresponds to the state the 
         | respondent votes in and this is what the district data refers
         | to.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2012): D4003
         |
         | It is a common strategy of popular parties in Hong Kong to
         | present multiple party lists within a district. Thereby, they
         | increase the chance of more candidates to win seats in the
         | election. CSES counts the number of parties which presented

         | party is only counted once. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2011 & 2014): D4003

         | In the New Zealand electoral system, candidates are voted

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2014): D4003

         | For Sweden 2014, this variable provides the number of parties 
         | which ordered ballots prior to the election as required by the
         | Swedish Election Authority. The Swedish system allows
         | for apparentment in which multiple lists with the same party
         | label in a given constituency can form a cartel. If these cases
         | parties were only counted once in line with this variable's 
         | intention to count the parties that presented lists rather than
         | the total number of lists provided by parties.

         | In some instances, parties are coded as having received zero

         | the same time, a number of voters in this district report to 
         | have voted for these parties. One such example is the district
         | "Kanton Obwalden" (District 6 in variable D2032) where the 
         | Social Democratic Party (SP / PS) is coded as zero percent 
         | percent for D4004_B but where multiple respondents report to
         | have voted for both the party list (D3006_LH_PL) and/or the 
         | district candidate (D3006_LH_DC). This presumably results from
         | voters using their empty ballot to vote for a candidate or 
         | party list that did not officially compete in their district.
         | The zero percent thus reflects either that a party did not 
         | receive any votes at all or, that they did not officially 
         | compete in a district. These data remain unchanged.

         |
         | This variable indicates the turnout in the presidential
         | election by federal state.
         |
         | The turnout is calculated with the denominator being
         | the Voting Age Population (VAP) as this is the most appropriate
         | comparable measure. The American Elections Project also provides
         | information on the Voting Eligible Population (VEP), which
         | calculates turnout on the basis of eligibility, rather than
         | the Voting Age Population. Analysts may refer to the website
         | link below to access this data.
         |
         | A different source other than the Federal Election Commission
         | had to be consulted for D4005 as the Federal Election
         | Commission does not provide an estimate of the size of the
         | the electorate, hence making an estimate of turnout impossible.
         | Instead, data from the United States Elections
         | Project by Michael McDonald is used 
         | (see: http://www.electproject.org/2012g, Date accessed: February 
         | 2015). For some states, the total number of votes in the
         | presidential elections differed from the numbers indicated by
         | the US Federal Election Commission.

         | (circunscripciones plurinominales) given by proportional 
         | representation. 
         | Each voter can cast only one vote that counts for two things: to
         | elect the 300 deputies by the plurality rule and to determine 
         | the percentage of votes that each party obtained in the election
         | in order to give the seats of proportional representation that 
         | each party will obtain (200 seats). 
         | In the 2015 legislative election voters could vote for either 
         | individual parties/candidates or for alliances. The election

         | [Note from the Collaborator]: Notice that the number of
         | registered voters is larger than the voting age population
         | (10%). In an extraordinary effort done in the 1990's, in a
         | house-by-house visit the Electoral Commission made a census
         | of all eligible voters. Independent estimates found that
         | this original census covered close to 98% of the voting age
         | population of the time (persons 18 years older and more).
         | This difference indicates that the actual list of eligible
         | voters ("lista nominal") has not been fully updated, most
         | likely because of persons who have passed away and are not
         | taken out from the list. Another likely source of error might
         | be due to the fact that people who would turn 18 years
         | the year of the election and before election day can register
         | to vote. So the 2010 number does not take into account the new

         | VARIABLE NOTES: D5006_2
         | 
         | The Voting Age Population (VAP) includes all citizens above the
         | legal voting age in a country. It is not intended to be a 
         | precise measure of the number of citizens entitled to vote as it
         | does not take into account legal or systematic impediments such 
         | as resident non-citizens. Rather, its intent is to provide an 
         | estimate of turnout besides estimates based solely on an 
         | electoral register. Voter registers are often outdated or 
         | inaccurate or in some circumstances are not used for elections
         | (e.g.: 1994 South African elections)         
         |
         | In some polities, voters are registered automatically and hence
         | it might be expected that the electoral register measure and the
         | voting age population would be identical. This is not always the
         | case for the reasons set out above. However, and unless we can
         | verify accuracy, CSES reports the voting age population as 
         | listed by the IDEA. However, ELECTION STUDY NOTES below do alert 
         | users to instances where voter registration is automatic and  
         | thus to cases which in theory the ER and VAP estimates could be 
         | identical. 
         |
         | Turnout data refers to lower house elections unless otherwise 
         | specified. Please refer to ELECTION STUDY NOTES.         
         | 
         | In Presidential elections with two rounds of voting, turnout
         | data refers to first round of elections. 
         |
         | Turnout data primarily comes from the International Institute 
         | for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) Voter Turnout 
         | Database. During the fielding of Module 4, the IDEA website 
         | from where the data was sourced changed. The most up to date 
         | website is: http://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout                     
         | (Date accessed: May 17, 2018). Previously, data was also 
         | obtained from the old IDEA website, previously available at:

         | D5006_2 would be identical (74.91%). These data does not assume

         | This data refers to the alliance in the current presidential 
         | election. The Prime minister, Victor Ponta, is a member of the
         | Social-Democrat Party (PSD), Partidul Social Democrat, the 
         | dominant party in an alliance of parties supporting a single 
         | candidate in this election.
         | During his time in office, Victor Ponta presided over 4 
         | different cabinets. At the time of this election the so-called 
         | Ponta 3 Cabinet was in office. It is considered that a cabinet 
         | is different from the previous one even if the prime minister is
         | the same if it required parliamentary approval to be installed 
         | (cabinet reshuffles are allowed without parliament approval only
         | if the political composition, i.e. political parties 
         | represented, of the cabinet stays the same).

         | Note from the Collaborator: The Prime Minister is generally 
         | chosen by the President. In a broad sense, one could say that 
         | the Prime Minister belongs to the Frontier Party because he was 
         | chosen by the President belonging to the Frontier Party 
         | [Party A (1)], which means that the Prime Minister probably has 
         | the same political view with the President.

         | There is no formal PM in Switzerland. Instead, executive power
         | is exercised by a collective organism called the Federal Council

         | by the Federal Assembly (which is composed of two organs, the
         | Council of States and National Council) for a four-year term.
         | Since 1959 the Federal Council has been composed of a coalition
         | of all major parties (SVP/UDC, SP/PS, FDP/PRD, and CVP/PDC), an
         | arrangement called the "magic formula." The Council elects each
         | year among its members a president, but this position is
         | presumably largely ceremonial. Consequently, this variable is
         | coded with 97 "Not-applicable."

         |   129. The Petrobras corruption scandal (national oil 
         |        company). This scandal concerned bribes and 
         |        laundering money that involved former ministers, 
         |        the Workers' Party (the government party), and 
         |        Congressional representatives of many government 
         |        supporting parties. It resulted in corruption being
         |        a key issue, in particular in the Presidential election. 
         |        The Workers' Party (PT) was coming to the end of three 
         |        consecutive terms of holding the Presidency.  
         |   130. The strong polarization between the first and second 
         |        rounds of the Presidential elections. The corruption 
         |        scandals, the programmatic differences between parties 
         |        and candidates, especially the issue of privatization 
         |        and personal attacks where the main themes in the final 
         |        three weeks of the 2014 elections. The weeks after the 
         |        election were noted for being particularly polarized 
         |        with intense demonstrations via conventional and social 
         |        media, coinciding with the fieldwork of the 2014 
         |        Brazilian Election Study.
         |   131. The death of the presidential candidate of the 
         |        Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) Eduardo Campos at the 
         |        beginning of the campaign. He was considered to be a 
         |        threat to the incumbent President Rousseff. The PSB 
         |        selected Marina Silva as their standard bearer in the
         |        election after Campos' death. She came close to 
         |        obtaining enough votes to proceed to the second round 
         |        run off but was defeated by Aecio Neves from the 
         |        Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB). 
         |   132. Economy and the continuity of the Workers' Party at the
         |        Federal Government level. The maintenance of economic 
         |        conditions, employment levels, and investment in social 
         |        programs were prominent. 
         |   133. Religion and moral values: The presence of very distinct
         |        candidates in the first round stimulated debate about 
         |        gay marriage, abortion, and creationism. Marina Silva, 
         |        the PSD candidate for the Presidency is a prominent 
         |        evangelical Christian in Brazil.

         |   135. Lack of media freedom and therefore very biased media 
         |        coverage.
         |   136. Economic crisis creating fears and looking for simple 
         |        solutions (including populist and nationalistic ideas).
         |   137. Purchasing votes (a wide-spread practice over many years
         |        now, which is practiced by many parties).
         |   138. Street protests against the previous government that 
         |        lasted for more than a year (protesters were not 
         |        organized in a party running for seats in the Parliament
         |        and therefore, they provoked the elections, but did not

         |   124. General orientations: the NDP made gains among the 
         |        left-leaning voters (economically and socially). These
         |        factors also account for Conservative support.  
         |   125. Leadership: the NDP made gains due to its leader's 
         |        climbing popularity and priming. The Conservative 
         |        leader is also appreciated by many.   
         |   126. Partisanship: the Conservatives have the largest group
         |        of partisans.   
         |   127. Issues: the NDP captured voters who favor spending more
         |        on health and the environment and higher corporate taxes.   
         |   128. Campaign strategy: the Bloc's focus on Quebec sovereignty
         |        led some soft nationalists to leave the party and support 
         |        the NDP.

         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   065. History of the Government of National Unity. With all 
         |        sides, including the political parties and the media, 
         |        agreeing prior to the campaign to promote calm and 
         |        refrain from using potentially inflammatory language, the
         |        election period was mostly peaceful. However, some 
         |        observers pointed to a harsher security environment and a
         |        large degree of self-censorship. 
         |        (Source: Freedom House Report 2014 Kenya.)
         |   066. International Criminal Court (ICC) trials. Throughout 
         |        2013, the impending ICC trials of Kenyatta and his deputy
         |        president, William Ruto, for crimes against humanity in 
         |        connection with the 2007-08 postelection violence loomed
         |        large. Witnesses against them disappeared or withdrew 
         |        amid threats, and civil society organizations and media
         |        outlets that focused on the trials faced intimidation. 
         |        (Source: Freedom House Report 2014 Kenya)
         |   067. The new constitution. The new constitution was intended 
         |        to reduce the role of ethnicity in elections. Although 
         |        the Political Parties Act requires each party to have at
         |        least 1,000 members in 24 of the 47 counties as a 
         |        mechanism for ensuring diversity, ethnicity remains an 
         |        entrenched political factor, as the major coalitions 
         |        reflected distinctive, though rarely exclusive, ethnic 
         |        groupings. The stipulation that all voters must possess
         |        a National Identity Card impeded historically 
         |        marginalized groups from greater access to the political
         |        process, in particular nearly seven million pastoralists
         |        from the upper Rift Valley and North Eastern Provinces. 
         |        Finally, ongoing extra judicial harassment by the security
         |        forces on the substantial Somali population diminished 
         |        their electoral opportunities.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2012): D5019
         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   040. The state of the economy. Even though the "war" waged
         |        by the government of President Calderon and its
         |        consequences have been felt by most Mexicans,
         |        either indirectly or directly, as the candidates did not
         |        present different alternatives to deal with drug dealers
         |        it probably did not have a major effect on the direction
         |        of citizens' vote. Those people who supported the war
         |        against drugs tended to support Calderon's government,
         |        and by itself the war against drugs did not seem to sway
         |        voters during the campaign.
         |   041. The candidacy of Gabriel Quadri de la Torre to the
         |        presidency by Nueva Alianza brought a different tone to
         |        the campaign. Quadri was not a member of Nueva Alianza so
         |        he presented himself as an independent candidate bringing
         |        in the voice of the citizenry. He managed to invigorate
         |        the first half of the campaign and to attract young 
         |        voters with his liberal discourse. He managed to maintain
         |        some effect after the debates and give Nueva Alianza more
         |        than enough votes it needed to maintain its registration.
         |   042. "Yo soy 132". College students, both from private and
         |        public universities, created a movement called "Yo soy
         |        132" (I am 132). It originated from a visit of
         |        Enrique Pena Nieto, PRI's candidate, to the Jesuit
         |        university in Mexico City (Universidad Iberoamericana).
         |        There, students started booing and opposing the candidate
         |        because when he was governor of the State of Mexico
         |        (Estado de Mexico) he ordered the police to break up a
         |        protest by local residents at Atenco. The police used
         |        force and two protesters were killed, and human rights
         |        groups have charged the police with multiple rapes and
         |        violence during that event. The candidate defended his
         |        decision to use force at the time of the protest and he
         |        had to leave the auditorium because of the opposition
         |        from the students. The media and the PRI dismissed the
         |        event and said that it was an incident created by 131
         |        students. Thus, a movement, mainly through social media,
         |        started  with the name "Yo soy 132". The movement took
         |        place mostly, but not only, in Mexico City. There were
         |        protests in Guadalajara, Puebla, Merida, San Cristobal de
         |        las Casas, Hermosillo, Cuernavaca, Tijuana, among others.
         |        Students protested both the media coverage and the PRI's
         |        political positioning on human rights issues and
         |        corruption. Students wanted to organize their own
         |        presidential debate, which they successfully did. All the
         |        candidates, except from Pena Nieto who said that there
         |        were no conditions for impartiality, attended the debate.
         |   043. The support from all the members of the PAN to the
         |        candidate Josefina Vasquez Mota, was not clear throughout
         |        the election. President Calderon did not seem to be
         |        behind her a hundred percent and former President Vicente
         |        Fox publicly announced that he would vote for Enrique
         |        Pena Nieto, the PRI's candidate. Vasquez Mota did not
         |        have clear conservative position on several social issues
         |        such as abortion, which could have also affected the
         |        support from the panista base.
         |   044. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador created a movement called
         |        MORENA (Movimiento de Regeneracion Nacional, National
         |        Regeneration Movement). He asked people to support and
         |        vote for MORENA. But MORENA was not a party so some
         |        analysts argue that some less educated and sophisticated
         |        people could get confused at the time of voting looking
         |        for the MORENA logo.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PHILIPPINES (2016): D5019
         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   182. Revolt of the middle class against the administration of 
         |        Pres. Nonoy Aquino. The win of Rody Duterte despite his 
         |        late entry in the presidential race exemplified the anger
         |        of the middle class against the administration of Pres. 
         |        Noynoy Aquino. Despite the economic success of the Aquino
         |        administration, the middle class felt that they suffered 
         |        most from the lack of public services, unfulfilled 
         |        promises and break down of peace and order. They see that
         |        the poor have their own targeted economic program 
         |        (Conditional Cash Transfers) and the rich getting richer 
         |        because of the economic success while they were left out 
         |        suffering.
         |   183. Drugs and crime as campaign issues. Rody Duterte veered 
         |        away from the traditional campaign issues of solving 
         |        poverty and uplifting the economic conditions of 
         |        Filipinos. He focused on addressing the drug and crime 
         |        problems of the country which was received positively by 
         |        Filipinos.
         |   184. Use of social media in campaign. The early stages of the 
         |        campaign of Rody Duterte was marred by lack of funds from
         |        potential donors. This was evident with the dearth of 
         |        political advertisements in traditional media like TV, 
         |        radio and newspapers which his rivals have been 
         |        capitalizing on from the start. His campaign staff and 
         |        group of volunteers turned to Facebook and Youtube to 
         |        convey his campaign messages and platforms. This effort 
         |        was so effective that each of his campaign posts became 
         |        viral.
         |   185. Citizenship case against Grace Poe. Some analyst believes
         |        that the citizenship case against Grace Poe is one of the
         |        factors she relinquished the early lead in most 
         |        pre-election surveys. She cannot really campaign without 
         |        being asked about her case. The case was finally resolved
         |        2 months before elections but it was too late since she
         |        was now overtaken by Rody Duterte for the lead in the 
         |        polls.
         |   186. Televised Presidential debate. The televised debate was 
         |        one of the important tools that the voters used in 
         |        deciding whom to vote for in the May 2016 elections. 
         |        Awareness of the debate was 54% during the first debate 
         |        and 74% in the last debate. Plurality of the respondents
         |        polled after the debate mentioned Rody Duterte as the 
         |        most sincere candidate who will fulfill his campaign 
         |        promises.

         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   070. Economic crisis and relative economic success
         |        of Poland.
         |   071. The consequences of the airplane crash at Smolensk
         |        in 2010, where the President of Poland and ninety-
         |        plus other high-ranked Polish officials lost their lives.
         |   072. Radicalism of the main opposition party (PiS) in
         |        their electoral appeal.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2015): D5019
         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   119. The slender economic recovery experienced since 2014
         |        - following the successful completion of the bailout 
         |        program by the International Monetary Fund, the European
         |        Central Bank and the European Commission (2011-2014) - 
         |        probably was beneficial for the right-wing coalition, 
         |        which had carried out a very strict economic adjustment 
         |        program as prescribed by international lenders.
         |   120. The fratricidal dispute which culminated in the election 
         |        of current Prime Minister Antonio Costa as leader of the 
         |        Socialist Party only 10 months before the general 
         |        election of 2015 - after defeating his predecessor 
         |        Antonio Jose Seguro in the first open primary in the 
         |        history of PS - may have had something to do with the 
         |        party's disappointing electoral results. 
         |   121. The pre-electoral coalition between both incumbent 
         |        parties on the right side of the political spectrum (the 
         |        Social Democratic Party and the People's party) allowed 
         |        them to aggregate overlapping electorates and 
         |        consequently, to prevent intra-bloc competition and 
         |        benefit from electoral system disproportionality.
         |   122. The prominence acquired by two Left Bloc Members of 
         |        Parliament - Mariana MortÃ¡gua (during extraordinary 
         |        committee hearings on the collapse of a pivotal 
         |        Portuguese private bank; BES) and Catarina Martins (the
         |        coordinator of the party) - in the months leading to the
         |        general election, enabled B.E. to achieve its best result
         |        since the formation of the party in 1999.   
         |   123. The bailout of 2011 still hovered over the general 
         |        election of 2015. Some electors still blamed the 
         |        Socialist Party for filing for bankruptcy in 2011; others
         |        resented the right-wing coalition for the hardships 
         |        caused by the already mentioned economic adjustment 
         |        program.   

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2012):  D5019
         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   187. The President: Traian Basescu was very unpopular,   
         |        turning not just the election itself,
         |        but also the events preceding it throughout 2012,
         |        largely into a referendum on him.                
         |   188. Referendum: In the summer of 2012, a newly formed 
         |        parliamentary majority (PSD, PNL, and a few smaller 
         |        parties) suspended President Basescu, but this political
         |        decision was not confirmed in a subsequent referendum, 
         |        due to low turnout (even though the vast majority of 
         |        those who voted did so in favor of the suspension). 
         |   189. Street protests: The year 2012 started with street 
         |        protests against the President and the government (for
         |        the first half of 2012, the government was formed by the
         |        PD-L and was backed by Basescu). The protests, which 
         |        eventually led to the fall of the government (which was 
         |        replaced, in a first instance, by a more technocratic 
         |        government, and a few months later by a government 
         |        formed by the former opposition - PSD, PNL and their 
         |        allies), started because of popular discontent with a 
         |        proposal to privatize the health emergency response 
         |        system, but they were also a symptom of a much larger, 
         |        discontent with the incumbent government, particularly 
         |        President Basescu.  
         |   190. Plagiarism: Several members of the new government formed
         |        by PSD and PNL in the summer of 2012 - most notably, the
         |        Prime Minister and leader of the PSD, Victor Ponta - were 
         |        accused of plagiarism. In Victor Ponta's case, the 
         |        Minister of Education in his government made changes at 
         |        the very last moment in organizations dealing with 
         |        plagiarism in order to avoid a verdict against Ponta. 
         |        Critics of the new government argued that this was just 
         |        an example of how the new government was changing the 
         |        rules of the democratic game in its favor 
         |        (e.g.: changing the Ombudsman overnight with a person 
         |        close to them, or an unsuccessful attempt to change the 
         |        electoral law to an SMD plurality system).
         |   191. Economy/austerity: The austerity measures taken in the  
         |        years following the economic crisis of 2008-2009 have 
         |        affected quite dramatically the population, especially 
         |        low-income Romanians (public employees, pensioners).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2014): D5019
         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   192. Ensuring voting rights for the diaspora. Romania grants 
         |        its citizens living abroad the right to vote in 
         |        parliamentary and presidential elections. The incumbent 
         |        government, led by PSD leader and presidential candidate
         |        Victor Ponta, was perceived as trying to hinder the 
         |        access to voting of the diaspora, which usually votes for
         |        the PSD in small numbers. This has led to significant 
         |        protests between the two rounds of the elections, 
         |        intensified by the refusal of the government to do more 
         |        in order to facilitate voting for the diaspora. Against 
         |        this background, the second round of the elections has 
         |        seen a significantly higher turnout and has led to the 
         |        victory of the opposition candidate. This issue 
         |        overshadows by far any other factors.
         |   193. Involvement of secret services in politics, media and the
         |        judicial system. In the months prior to the elections 
         |        there have been intense discussions on the fact that 
         |        Romanian secret services have placed undercover officers
         |        with the judicial system (prosecutors, courts), media 
         |        outlets and political parties. The discussions were 
         |        initiated once a reputed journalist has publicly admitted
         |        to have been an undercover officer and culminated with 
         |        unproven accusations (made by incumbent president Traian
         |        Basescu during the electoral campaign) that the incumbent
         |        Prime Minister and presidential candidate Victor Ponta 
         |        had also been an undercover officer of the External 
         |        Informations Service (SIE, Serviciul de Informatii 
         |        Externe).
         |   194. Negative campaign: The campaign of Victor Ponta and the 
         |        PSD has been very negative in tone with multiple attacks
         |        towards the main opposition candidate (ethnic German, 
         |        Protestant Klaus Iohannis) on issues related to religion,
         |        ethnicity and personal life. Accusations and attacks 
         |        included among others references to involvement in child
         |        trafficking and being unfit for office because the 
         |        Iohannis family has no children.
         |   195. Widespread corruption. The 2014 presidential campaign 
         |        took place in a context marred by citizens’ perception
         |        of widespread political corruption, enforced by the 
         |        increasing number of arrests and accusations made by the 
         |        National Anti-Corruption Department (DNA). Many 
         |        politicians accused of wrongdoing by the DNA have claimed
         |        they are wrongly accused and that accusations are 
         |        politically motivated.
         |   196. Scandal: Victor Ponta’s plagiarized PhD thesis. In 2012 
         |        Victor Ponta was accused of plagiarizing large portions 
         |        on his PhD thesis. The Prime Minister had denied 
         |        wrongdoing. However, his government has used various 
         |        legal and administrative measures to ensure he is not 
         |        officially declared guilty of plagiarism and stripped of
         |        his PhD title. This topic has persisted on the public 
         |        agenda and was specifically mentioned during the 
         |        electoral campaign for the presidential election.

         |        well as opposition obstructions and interpellations.
         |   091. Economic crisis: rise of global and national economic 
         |        instability and crisis. With the aim to solve crisis 
         |        government proposed a set of reform packages which were 
         |        not confirmed by the Parliament, for three of them 
         |        referendums were called in 2011 (1) referendum on mini 
         |        jobs on April 10, 2011; 2) referendum on Prevention of 
         |        Undeclared Work and Employment Act on June 5, 2011; 3)

         |        of government, the ANC campaign highlighted that 
         |        it had "A good story to tell" about 20 years of 
         |        successful service delivery.
         |   170. Scandal around President Zuma's private residence

         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the collaborators were:
         |   105. D.dos attack: D.dos attack hit the web-site of the 
         |        National Election Commission on October 26, 2011 the 
         |        Seoul Mayoral Election. Because of this attack, voters 
         |        were not able to access this website and check the voting
         |        place. The secretary Kong of the politician Gu-sik Choi 
         |        and other people related to the Grand National Party 
         |        raised this scandal.
         |   106. Problematic nomination in the United Democratic Party. 
         |        They had difficulties to nominate candidates until the 
         |        nomination deadline and a lot of conflicts and doubts 
         |        such as a rigged election on mobile voting during the 
         |        process of the nominations.
         |   107. Bribery at the party progress in the Grand National Party
         |        (after: the Frontier Party). The politician Seung-duk Koh
         |        revealed that he received a bribe from a politician of 
         |        the Grand National Party at the party progress in the 
         |        Grand National Party in 2008 and was elected.

         |        the United Democratic Party: 8 years ago, the politician 
         |        Yong-min Kim who was a candidate in the 19th General

         | The presidential election due in February 2015 was moved up by

         | According to the Greek Constitution, the president is elected by

         | round) or, failing that, by a three-fifths majority on the third

         | commissioner and deputy leader of ND. However, the opposition 
         | parties had already declared that they would vote against the 
         | government nominee regardless of the choice. The leaders of 
         | SYRIZA and ANEL were fairly forthcoming in regard to their 
         | motivation to use the election of the president as a tool to 
         | force an election that would oust the ND-PASOK government. As

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2012 & 2015): D5033
         |
         | The electoral law amendment of 2008 (law 3636/2008) was passed
         | in 2008 only to be implemented in the "one after the next"
         | election. Hence, the current code differs from the one for the
         | Greece (2009) study from CSES Module 3.
         |
         | "2.a. The independent Party that came first in valid votes in
         | the electoral District of Greece, beside the seats that are
         | allocated to it according to paragraph 1, gains fifty (50) more
         | seats, which are derived from the electoral peripheries that
         | have seats not allocated after the conclusion of the procedure
         | in accordance with the provisions of article 6.
         | These extra fifty (50) seats could be also gained by a party
         | coalition, under the condition that the average of the
         | percentages that the Parties of the coalition gained is higher
         | than the percentage of the independent Party that came first in
         | valid votes. This average is obtained by the division of the
         | percentage that the fore mentioned party coalition gained
         | divided by the number of Parties that it consists of." [Excerpt
         | from Law 3636/2008: Article 1, Paragraph 2a (Amendment of law
         | 3231/2004 "Election of the Members of the Parliament").]
         |
         | This means that if a party coalition gets the relative
         | majority but its average power is less than the power of the
         | independent party that gets the higher percentage among the
         | independent parties the extra fifty seats gained by this
         | independent party.

         | is required to reach 10% of the valid votes. 
         | Alternatively, a party that win six district seats in the 
         | Chamber of Deputies or three district seats in the Senate 
         | may also receive seats.

         | According to Polish electoral law, subject of electoral
         | competition are Electoral Committees of parties, not parties as
         | such. Electoral committee can be formed by individual parties,
         | or coalition of parties. A candidate can be endorsed by ONLY ONE
         | electoral committee. However, the list of candidates of an
         | electoral committee can contain candidates supported by (only
         | one) political party different than the party which formed the 
         | electoral committee. Usually it means that a candidate from a 
         | smaller party is a guest on the candidate list of electoral 
         | committee of a bigger party. In this case, Official Electoral
         | Announcements (posters which one can find in the polling 
         | stations) contain information that a candidate is supported by 
         | different a party than the party of his/her electoral committee.
         | However, on the voting ballot one can find only the name of an
         | electoral committee.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2012): D5037
         |
         | In Mexico, private financing of parties and candidates is
         | extremely limited: one person cannot contribute more than a few
         | dollars, and corporate entities cannot finance campaigns or
         | parties. The electoral commission determines the amount for the
         | upcoming election (mostly based on past experiences), and 30% of
         | the total is distributed equally among all registered parties,
         | and 70% according to last electoral results. For that reason,
         | even when more than one party supports a candidate, voters have
         | to mark the logo of the party they prefer. If voters cross more
         | than one party with the same candidate, that vote is divided
         | among those parties the voter marked.

         |
         | For lower house elections, Australia employs the Alternative
         | Vote system. In this system, voters are required
         | to list their  preferences for as many candidates
         | as there are on the ballot. Thus, the total number of votes
         | varies across electoral districts.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2013): D5038_3
         |
         | For upper house elections, Australia employs a single-
         | transferable-vote form of proportional representation. In this
         | system each voter indicates the order of preference among all
         | the candidates in competing in her district, or alternatively,
         | she can indicate support for a party ticket (which determines
         | the order of preference of candidates within the party).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2013): D5038_1
         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the
         | regional districts tier, the Land level tier (or state level)
         | and the federal (or national) level tier. Counting and
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels.
         | However, voters cast a single vote. In this vote, they can
         | express preferences for specific candidates, particularly, a
         | Laender level candidate and/or for a regional level candidate.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote
         | separately in different tiers. Hence, the system is coded as
         | consisting of a single tier in variables D5038-D5047.

         | for an 8-year term and the chamber is composed of 81 members, 
         | with each state in Brazil having three Senators each. 
         | Members are elected in alternative electoral cycles: two thirds 
         | of the Senate seats (n=54) are contested in one election cycle 
         | while the remaining  one third are contested in the other. The 
         | 2014 elections saw a third of the Senate seats contested (n=27). 
         | Accordingly, voters therefore had one vote in this election as 
         | only one Senator per State was being selected.

         | between 4 and 16 representatives.  Representatives are elected 
         | according to a proportional representation system based on open 
         | party lists. Voter first selects the party/coalition of his/her 
         | choice and then he/she can choose a preference to a particular 
         | candidate in the relevant list. The preference contributes to 
         | the ranking of the candidate. If no candidate preference is

         | elected not in a specified constituency but throughout the
         | country at large. These are the State Deputies, whose exact
         | number depends on the total electoral strength of each party.
         | Finally, there are 50 'bonus' seats awarded to the party

         |
         | Hong Kong has a unicameral legislature. The Legislative Council
         | of the HKSAR has 70 members. Half of the legislative council is
         | returned by geographic constituency (popular) elections; the
         | other half is returned by functional constituency elections.
         | Election data on Hong Kong electoral institutions refer to the 
         | geographical constituency elections only.
         | In the Geographical Constituency (GC) part of the Election, Hong
         | Kong is divided into 5 constituencies and voters elect 
         | candidates by universal suffrage. The number of LegCo seats in 
         | each constituency is decided according to the constituency 
         | population. The voting system adopted is the closed list 
         | proportional representation system. Geographical Constituency is
         | treated here as the first segment of the LegCo.
         | There are two parts of the Functional Constituencies (FCs): the 
         | traditional FCs and the District Council (Second) FC.
         | The traditional FCs return 30 LegCo members. Registration as a 
         | voter in some traditional Fcs requires certain qualifications, 
         | for example, registered medical practitioners or dentists for 
         | the Medical FC. Note that in some FCs, voters are individuals, 
         | while in others, 'voters' are not individuals but companies or 
         | organizations.
         | The District Council (Second) FC is treated here as the second 
         | segment of the LegCo. This segment returns 5 LegCo members. In 
         | this part of election, the whole of Hong Kong has one 
         | constituency only and the voting system adopted is the closed 
         | list proportional representation system. Candidates must be 
         | elected District Council members who are nominated by no less 
         | than 15 other elected District Council members; whereas voters
         | are registered GC electors who are not registered in other Fcs.

         | roughly equal-sized single member districts. The second segment
         | is comprised of 180 seats allocated on the basis of proportional
         | representation in 11 regional multi-member districts.
         |
         | The Upper House (House of Councilors) has 242 members who are
         | elected in two electoral segments, for a 6 year term, where half
         | of the members (121) stand for re-election every three years.
         | The first segment consists of 47 prefecture-level districts
         | where 73 representatives in each election are chosen by simple
         | majority. Successful candidates are decided in the order of the
         | number of valid votes obtained on the basis of the comparative
         | plurality.
         | The second segment is represented by a single nation-wide
         | district based on proportional representation (D'Hondt method),
         | where 48 representatives are elected in a single electoral

         | Mexican voters cast a single vote in a single member district
         | plurality election. However, this also counts for the allocation
         | of the proportional representation seats disputed in the larger
         | regional multi-member districts (five circumscriptions). Thus,
         | voters are not allowed to split their vote, in fact, the same
         | vote is subject to a double counting that produces two-seat
         | relevant vote totals. The first vote total determines who wins
         | the plurality in the single-member district (300 seats). The
         | second serves to allocate seats in the multi-member districts
         | (200 seats). The PR seats are allocated according to the
         | aggregate distribution of votes of multi-member districts.
         | For a party to be entitled to have members of proportional
         | representation in the Lower Chamber, it must attain at
         | least 2% of the total votes cast for these elections.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2012 & 2015): D5038_3-D5038_4
         |
         | For senatorial (Upper House) elections, voters cast a single
         | vote in 3-seat multi-member districts (which correspond to the
         | country's 31 states plus the Federal District). The first two
         | seats are awarded to the plurality winner and the third seat is
         | given to the first runner-up. This vote also counts for the
         | allocation of proportional representation seats disputed in one
         | national district. Thus, each vote is subject to a double
         | counting that produces two-seat relevant vote totals. The first
         | vote total determines who wins in the multi-member districts (96
         | seats), and the second serves to allocate through proportional
         | representation the resting 32 seats. For the allocation of the
         | PR seats the national distribution of votes excludes non valid
         | votes, votes for parties that obtained less than 2% and votes
         | for non-registered candidates.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2013): D5038_2
         |
         | The Norwegian Parliament comprises 169 seats in two tiers:
         | 150 members are elected in 19 multi-member districts using
         | proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats are
         | compensatory and are allocated to parties that receive 4%+ of
         | the national vote. These seats are known as "members at large"
         | and are seen as a means of evening out discrepancies between
         | the number of votes received and the number of seats in the
         | Storting. The distribution is based on a comparison of the
         | actual distribution of seats with what would have been occurred
         | had the country been treated as on big constituency, thus
         | allowing a determination to be made as to which parties are
         | under-represented. These parties are then awarded "seats at
         | large" in the constituencies where they were closest to winning
         | an ordinary seat. While voters do not cast a ballot directly for
         | this tier and the seats are awarded at the national level
         | (albeit dispersed at the constituency level), it is widely 
         | acknowledged to constitute a separate tier of the electoral 
         | system.

         | The Philippines Senate (Senado) has 24 members, serving six-
         | years terms. Concurrently with presidential elections, half
         | of the Senate (12 members) is renewed each three years, in a
         | single nation-wide constituency. Senators are elected
         | according to the simple majority, and each voters can cast
         | up to 12 votes. Hence, vote percentages and national totals
         | are not meaningful data. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2014): D5038
         |
         | The 2014 Romanian election study is concerned with the 
         | Presidential elections of 2014. 
         | However, the information about the electoral system, presented 
         | in variables D5038-D5047 and D5058-D5075 concern the Lower and 
         | the Upper House of the Romanian parliament. Note that the below 
         | description refers to the electoral regulations from 2008, 
         | which were valid at the time of the 2014 elections. The 
         | electoral system was changed again in 2015.
         |
         | The 2008 electoral law prescribed a complex electoral system.
         | The system adopted was candidate centered, with voters having
         | one vote for the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) and one vote
         | for the Senate. The systems is classified as a mixed system 
         | because it employs both majoritarian and proportional rules. 
         | Voters cast ballots in single member districts. However, the 
         | complex seat allocation procedure operates over multiple tiers.
         | The division of seats between tiers is variable and depends on 
         | the actual result of voting. In extreme theoretical 
         | circumstances, it is possible for one tier not to receive seats 
         | at all. Overhang seats are allowed.
         | Districts are geographically identical to counties (41 County, 
         | plus one for Bucharest, and one for Romanians living abroad) and
         | each county is divided into several single member districts, 
         | known in Romania as ‘electoral colleges’. Voters are initially
         | aggregated at national level to determine which parties have 
         | passed the explicit electoral threshold (see variable D5046 and
         | variable D5047) and are thus eligible for seats. 
         | Direct seats are won by polling 50% in a district; however, 
         | candidates winning over 50% in their districts win the seat only
         | if their party passes the appropriate threshold. 
         | However, a party can also enter parliament if it wins at least 
         | three Senate and six Deputy districts in the first tier 
         | regardless of the percentage of votes the party obtains at the 
         | national level. 
         | To decide on seat allocation, the number of votes won by each of
         | the parties is totaled and divided by the number of seats 
         | (corresponding to the number of districts) established for each 
         | constituency, thus obtaining an electoral quota. Then, the 
         | number of votes won by each party is divided by the quota, 
         | thus giving the number of seats to which each party is entitled.
         | The second stage involves the remainders of these divisions 
         | being summed up for each party at the national level using the
         | D'Hondt system, thus giving a ranked list of parties. Then, in
         | the district, the first party on the list, regardless of its 
         | vote has priority in the redistribution process, the second 
         | party on the list follows, and so forth. Candidates belonging to
         | the parties that passed the threshold - winning over 50% of the 
         | votes in their district - are automatically elected and their 
         | districts are no longer included in the next stages of the seat
         | allocation process. 
         | The candidates from districts without a first round winner then 
         | enter the redistribution process. In each constituency, the 
         | candidates of each party are ranked in the order of the number 
         | of votes obtained by each of them in the district in which they
         | ran. Based on the quota, each party receives a number of seats 
         | corresponding to its quota. After this stage, the Electoral 
         | Commission determines the number of seats the party is entitled
         | to in the final distribution.
         | At the time, the Lower House had 315 seats contested in SMDs, 
         | and 18 seats reserved for ethnic minorities. After the 2012 
         | Parliamentary election, the actual size of the Lower House was
         | 412. Out of 315 SMDs, 240 seats were won directly, by winning 
         | above 50% of the votes. The remaining 75 seats were won through
         | the second-level allocation, via 43 electoral districts. In 
         | addition, there were 79 overhang seats. As a result, for 2012, 
         | the Chamber of Deputies elected 412 members, while the Senate 
         | elected 176 members. Seats are reserved in parliament for 18 
         | ethnic minority groups representing Germans, Roma, Macedonians,
         | Armenians, Bulgarians, Albanians, Jews, Tatars, Czechs/Slovaks, 
         | Russians/Lipovians, Serbs, Poles, Italians, Ukrainians, Turks, 
         | Croatians, and Ruthenians.

         |
         | In variables D5038-D5047, both the Chamber of deputies and the 
         | Senate are coded as having a single electoral segment (tier). 
         | Although for the purpose of seat allocation, the calculation 
         | procedure aggregates votes at different level (national, county), 
         | the systems goes back to the single member districts for the 
         | actual seat allocation. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SLOVENIA (2011): D5038_3
         |
         | Slovenia is considered to be a case of incomplete bicameralism.
         | The National Council could be regarded as the Upper House. It 
         | is supposed to be representative of social, economic, 
         | professional and local interest groups in Slovenia. However, 
         | since it is not only indirectly elected but also does not pass 
         | laws itself, variables D5038 to D5047 that refer to upper house 
         | are coded as 'Not applicable'.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH AFRICA (2014): D5038_1
         |
         | The South African electoral system is a closed-list 
         | proportional representation system. The National Assembly 
         | seats are filled in two tiers: Half (200) seats are 
         | regional seats and filled by reference to regional votes 
         | and regional lists (representing nine federal provinces); 
         | the other half (200) are national seats and filled by 
         | reference to national votes and national lists (or 
         | entirely from regional lists if a party did not submit 
         | a separate national list). 
         | Since voters have a single vote for the election of the 
         | National Assembly, and the system in effect uses one nationwide 
         | constituency (with 400 members) to elect MPs, the system is 
         | coded as consisting of one tier in variables D5038-D5047, and 
         | of two tiers in variables D5059, D5063-D5071.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2012): D5038_1-D5038_2
         |
         | Korea employs a mixed-member majoritarian system that combines 
         | 246 single-member districts (SMD) with 54 proportional 
         | representation (PR) seats, elected from a single nation-wide 
         | district. Each voter casts two votes, one for an individual 
         | candidate in the SMD segment, and one for a closed party list 
         | in the PR segment.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2014): D5038_1 D5038_2
         |
         | The Swedish Riksdag has 349 members, where 310 members are
         | elected from 29 multi-member constituencies. Additionally, 
         | 39 supplementary seats are distributed in order to achieve full
         | proportionality which are equivalent to a second tier. However, 
         | voters only cast a single vote and do not cast a separate ballot
         | for each tier in the system. Hence, variable D5038_2 for Sweden
         | was coded '97. Not Applicable'. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2011): D5038_1
         |
         | In Switzerland voters have as many votes as the number of seats
         | in their district (between 1 and 34 depending on the cantons).
         | Voters can choose one of the parties on the party lists, or they
         | can create their own list by filling an empty list on the ballot
         | with the candidates they prefer. Moreover, they can modify the
         | party (e.g. add candidates from other parties instead of a
         | candidates of the list [panachage]), delete candidates or vote
         | twice for a same candidate (cumulation).
         |
         | If a voter casts fewer votes than seats in the district, the
         | remaining votes go to the party indicated on the list. If
         | no party is indicated, the remaining votes are lost. Since all
         | candidates belong to a party, if a voters cast a single vote for
         | a candidate, that vote automatically counts for that candidate's
         | party list.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2011): D5038_3
         |
         | In 20 cantons of Switzerland voters have two votes, while in the
         | six so-called half-cantons (BL, BS, OW, NW, AI, AR) voters have
         | one vote. The number of votes is equal to the number of seats
         | elected in a particular canton (or half canton).

         | House (The House of Representatives; Sapha Phuthaen Ratsadon),
         | one for each of the two segments/tiers: a single-member
         | constituency vote (D5038_1) and the party list vote (D5038_2).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2011): D5038_3

         | Voters in Thailand have one vote in elections for the Senate.
         | The Senate is composed of 150 members, of whom 76 are
         | directly elected from the 75 Provinces of Thailand and
         | Bangkok. The remaining 74 Senators are appointed from various
         | sectors by the Senate Selection Committee.

         M16b. Do they vote for candidates (not party lists) or party
               lists?
               Definition: Party bloc voting is used in multi-member
               districts where voters cast a single party-centered vote for
               their party of choice; the party with the most votes wins
               all of the district seats.

         | The electoral rules (except the number of seats to be filled)
         | are subject of cantonal regulations. Therefore the electoral
         | system varies. Most cantons have two-round majoritarian
         | elections, where an absolute majority is required in the first
         | round. However, one canton uses a PR system for its two seats
         | (canton of Jura).

         | of the preferential votes at the regional level will be
         | placed at the top of the party list. In cases where several 
         | candidates receive over 5% of preferential votes, they

         M17. Are the votes transferable?
              Definition: In systems with preferential voting, a voter can
              express a list of preferences. For example, votes can be cast
              by putting a '1' in the column next to the voter's preferred
              candidate, a '2' beside their second favorite candidate and
              so on.Votes are counted according to the first preferences
              and any candidates who have achieved the predetermined quota
              are elected. To decide which of the remaining candidates are
              elected the votes are transferred from candidates who have
              more than the necessary number to achieve the quota and from
              the candidate with the least number of votes. An example of
              this is the election in Ireland in 2002.

         Democracy).

         The following decision rule is applied (see Cheibub, 2007):
         A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no
         independently (indirectly or directly) elected president or (ii)
         if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected
         president but the government is not responsible to the president.
         B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently
         (indirectly or directly) elected president and government is
         responsible to the president.
         C. The system is presidential if government is not responsible to
         the elected legislature.

         NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the
         executive depends directly on legislature (i.e. vote of
         confidence).

         |
         | Austrian executive power is coded as a mixed or semi-
         | presidential regime given that the president can dissolve the
         | National Council. Article 29 of the Constitution states:
         | "(1) The Federal President can dissolve the National Council,
         | but he may avail himself of this prerogative only once for the
         | same reason". However, in practice the system works mostly
         | as a parliamentary system (Muller, 2005).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2015): D5054
         |
         | Classifying the finish executive power is subject to some 
         | controversy. Here it is coded as a mixed or semi-presidential 
         | system. Some key features of the Finnish system that distinguish
         | it from a traditional parliamentary system are that by 
         | constitution a) the president is popularly elected by direct 
         | vote for a fixed term of six years, and for no more than two 
         | consecutive terms of office; b) the president can, on 
         | recommendation of the prime minister, dissolve the legislature; 
         | c) the president can veto legislature, though parliament can 
         | override the presidential veto with a simple majority; and 
         | d) the president may issue decrees that have force of law. 
         | Nonetheless, it has been argued that Finland, after 
         | constitutional reforms in the 1990's, works in practice as a 
         | parliamentary system.

         | The president is elected by the Parliament for a term of five

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2012): D5054
         |
         | Note that Hong Kong is not a sovereign state, but a Special 
         | Administrative Region (SAR) in China. The Central Government 
         | authorizes the HKSAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy and 
         | enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power. 
         | Therefore, the HKSAR Government is kind of local government.
         | The Chief Executive (CE) is the President of the Executive 
         | Council of Hong Kong and head of the Government of the Hong 
         | Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive is 
         | elected by an 800-member Election Committee. The elected CE 
         | must then be appointed by the Central People's Government.
         | Regarding the relationship between the CE and Legislative 
         | Council, the type of executive may be regarded as some form of a
         | presidential system, because the CE and the LegCo members are 
         | returned by different elections. 
         | According to the Article 52, the CE must resign in case of 
         | refusal to sign a bill passed by a two-thirds majority of the
         | Legislative Council.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ICELAND (2013): D5054

         | The coding of Iceland on this particular metric is subject to
         | various interpretation, with different sources providing
         | different estimates (for e.g.: the DPI classifies it
         | as parliamentary and Matt Golder considers it semi-
         | presidential). While Iceland does have a popularly elected
         | president, who does have powers under the Icelandic
         | constitution to dissolve parliament, submit a bill to
         | parliament, and exercise emergency powers, the powers
         | exercised have varied depending on the particular
         | person occupying the Presidency. Accordingly, the position
         | is largely considered ceremonial. Presidential elections are
         | also often uncontested (for e.g.: 2000 and 2008). For this
         | reason, CSES classifies Iceland as a parliamentary system.

         | The President of Slovenia is directly elected by universal 
         | adult suffrage once every five years.
         | There are just two possibilities when the President can dissolve 
         | the parliament but not on his/her initiative: a) It is the 
         | responsibility of the President to propose to the National 
         | Assembly a candidate for PM who then must obtain the required 
         | support in the National Assembly. If no candidates manage to 
         | secure the required majority of votes after three rounds, the 
         | president dissolves the National Assembly and calls new 
         | elections. 
         | b) Under very carefully detailed conditions and procedures, the 
         | National Assembly can be dissolved when the government fails to 
         | carry a vote of confidence. All these means that the president 
         | does not have a discretionary right to dissolve the National 
         | Assembly, but is obliged to do so in some constitutionally-

         PLURALITY - the candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE - A candidate must win over 50% of the vote
         to win. If no  candidate wins this many votes, then there is a
         runoff between the top two candidates.
         QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE - Each qualified majority system specifies
         a particular percentage of the vote that a candidate must win in
         order to be elected in the first round. If two or more candidates
         overcome these thresholds, then the one with the highest number of
         votes wins. The qualified majority systems vary in terms of the
         electoral procedure that applies when these thresholds are not
         met.
         ELECTORAL COLLEGE - The candidate that wins a plurality of the
         electoral college votes wins.
         SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE - Requires voters to rank single
         candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes are
         transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The
         candidate that obtains this quota first is elected.

D5058       >>> ELECTORAL FORMULA IN ALL ELECTORAL SEGMENTS
                         (TIERS)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This is a variable indicating whether the country uses (i) a
         majoritarian formula in all of its electoral segments (tiers),
         (ii) a proportional formula in all of its electoral segments
         (tiers), or (iii) a mixed formula.

         The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder's
         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World,
         1946-2000 (http://mattgolder.com/elections, Date accessed: May 17,
         2018).

         MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are
         considered majoritarian.
         PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that use
         party lists and those like the single transferable vote that do
         not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided into
         two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of
         remainders) and highest average systems.
         MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional
         electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in
         practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier).

         | For the Chamber of Deputies elections (lower house), Argentina
         | used a proportional closed-list system. Most parties use
         | primaries to select and order their party lists. Members elected
         | to the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term 
         | which is renewable. Half of the Chamber is renewed every two
         | years. There are 24 multi-member districts with a party/alliance
         | needing to exceed 3 percent of the registered electors to 
         | secure a seat.

         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the
         | federal level tier, the Land level tier (or state level) and the
         | regional districts tier. Counting and allocation of seats passes
         | through each of these levels.
         | Voters can cast a (single) party vote on an open list and
         | indicate their preferred candidate on the respective party list.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (2012): D5058
         |
         | Electoral reform came on to the agenda in Romania in the 
         | aftermath of 2004 elections and the election of a weak 
         | centre-right coalition between the National Liberal Party (PNL) 
         | and the Democratic (PD) parties. However, it was a feud between  
         | President of Romania and the Romanian parliament that brought
         | the issue to the fore. In 2007, the party alliance of the 
         | PNL and the PD split. The Romanian parliament then voted to 
         | impeach President Basescu, a proponent of electoral reform, 
         | accusing him of abuse of power. The row was sparked by the 
         | decision of then Justice Minister Monica Macovei to take the 
         | appointment of special prosecutors into the domain of the 
         | president, where previously it had been the responsibility of 
         | an independent body. A national referendum was held 
         | on May 19, 2007 to decide whether the president's dismissal by 
         | parliament would be upheld. However, the proposal was defeated
         | in a low turnout referendum and Basescu was reinstated as
         | Romanian President shortly afterwards. After his reinstatement, 
         | President Basescu made electoral reform a central issue,
         | calling for a national referendum on the subject. Initially 
         | President Basescu and Prime Minister Tariceanu put forward 
         | rival models of electoral reform. However, after months of 
         | debate on the subject, including a referendum on the issue, 
         | a compromise was eventually agreed and a new electoral system 
         | was adopted in time for the 2008 parliamentary elections. 
         | 
         | The system adopted was candidate centred, with voters having one
         | vote for the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) and one vote for
         | the Senate. The systems is classified as a mixed system because 
         | it employs both majoritarian and proportional rules.  Voters 
         | cast ballots in single member districts. However, the seat 
         | allocation procedure is notably complex and operates over 
         | multiple tiers. Districts are geographically identical to 
         | counties and each county is divided into several single member 
         | districts, known in Romania as colleges. Voters are initially 
         | aggregated at national level to determine which parties have
         | passed the explicit electoral threshold (see variable D5046 and
         | variable D5047) and are thus eligible for seats. 
         | Direct seats are won by polling 50% in a district; however, 
         | candidates winning over 50% in their districts win the seat
         | only if their party passes the appropriate threshold. 
         | However, a party can also enter parliament if it wins at least 
         | three Senate and six Deputy districts in the first tier  
         | regardless of the percentage of votes the party obtains at the 
         | national level. 
         | To decide on seat allocation, the number of votes won by each
         | of the parties is totalled and divided by the number of seats 
         | (corresponding to the number of districts) established for each
         | constituency, thus obtaining an electoral quota. Then, the
         | number of votes won by each party is divided by the quota, thus
         | giving the number of seats to which each party is entitled. The
         | second stage involves thee remainders of these divisions being
         | summed up for each party at the national level using the D'Hondt
         | system, thus giving a ranked list of parties. Then, in the
         | district, the first party on the list, regardless of its votes 
         | has priority in the redistribution process, the second party on
         | the list follows, and so forth. Candidates belonging to the
         | parties that passed the threshold - winning over 50% of the
         | votes in their district - are automatically elected and their
         | districts are no longer included in the next stages of the seat
         | allocation process. 
         | The candidates from districts without a first round winner then 
         | enter the redistribution process. In each constituency, the 
         | candidates of each party are ranked in the order of the number 
         | of votes obtained by each of them in the district in which they 
         | ran. Based on the quota, each party receives a number of seats
         | corresponding to its quota. After this stage, the Electoral 
         | Commission determines the number of seats the party is entitled
         | to in the final distribution.      
         | For 2012, the Chamber of Deputies elected 412 members and the 
         | Senate elected 176 members. Seats are reserved in parliament for
         | 18 ethnic minority groups representing Germans, Romas, 
         | Macedonians, Armenians, Bulgarians, Albanians, Jews, Tatars, 
         | Czechs/Slovaks, Russians/Lipovians, Serbs, Poles, Italians,

         | 150 members are elected in 19 multi-member districts using
         | proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats are
         | compensatory and are allocated to parties that receive 4%+ of
         | the national vote. These seats are known as "members at large"
         | and are seen as a means of evening out discrepancies between
         | the number of votes received and the number of seats in the
         | Storting. The distribution is based on a comparison of the
         | actual distribution of seats with what would have been occurred
         | had the country been treated as on big constituency, thus
         | allowing a determination to be made as to which parties are
         | under-represented. While voters do not cast a ballot directly 
         | for this second tier and the seats are awarded at the national
         | level (albeit dispersed at the constituency level), the tiers 
         | are considered linked because a voter casts only one ballot for 
         | both tiers and the fact that allocation of the 19 additional  
         | seats in part depends on how many seats are won by a party list
         | in the first tier.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2013): D5060
         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a (non-mixed) proportional
         | representation system with three segments or tiers. These
         | correspond to the federal level tier, the Land level tier (or
         | state level) and the regional districts tier. Counting and
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels, and
         | as a consequence is a three step process. In first place in each
         | Laender a Hare quota is calculated and used to distribute seats
         | across the regional districts. That is, parties are allocated
         | seats from each regional district depending on how often they
         | exceeded the Land level specified quota. Followed by this seats
         | are allocated at the Land level tier also following the Land
         | level quota. Finally, at the national level seats are
         | distributed following the D'Hondt system. Seats that have been
         | already allocated in the first and second tier are deducted from
         | from the number of seats each parties obtains at the national
         | level. Only those parties that obtain more than 4% of the
         | national valid votes or one seat from the regional
         | constituencies qualify to receive seats from the Laender and
         | National seat distribution. Given this last element the
         | electoral system is coded as linked.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (203): D5060
         |
         | In Japan's mixed electoral system, seats of both tiers are
         | allocated separately; each party is allocated its proportionate
         | share of the PR seats plus the SMD seats won by its candidates.
         | However, it is important to notice that candidates may run in
         | both the SMD districts as well as in the party list of the PR
         | contest. These so-called "duplicate" candidates are restricted
         | to run only in SMD constituency located within their PR bloc.
         | While this feature might create some implicit interdependence
         | between the segments, Japan's system is coded as un-linked since
         | the allocation of seats of each segment in done independently,
         | without considering the marginal results of the other segment.
         |
         | Data in variables D5058-D5062 refer to the Upper
         | House of Japanese Parliament, because the current Japanese

         |
         | The two tiers are linked with the 'party vote' for the national
         | party list (tier 2) acting as a compensatory mechanism to tier 1 
         | ('electorate vote'), ensuring that the total number of seats 
         | each party wins is near proportional to its total vote. Tier 2 
         | seats are allocated through a national party list using
         | proportional representation based on the Sainte-Lague Formula.

         | South Africa's electoral system is not mixed, but composed of 
         | two linked tiers that use proportional representation.
         | Parties present two lists to fill the National Assembly's seats:
         | 200 nominations on a 'national list' and a 200 candidates   
         | representing the nine provinces in the Assembly. Despite the
         | two lists, voters have a single vote. The tiers are linked since
         | successful candidates on a party's national list depend on its 
         | proportion of the national vote; successful candidates on its 
         | provincial lists depend on the proportion of the national vote
         | in each province.

         | seats is conducted, based on the total votes for each party at  
         | the national level. As such, the 39 supplementary seats are  
         | allocated to ensure the result is as close as possible to 
         | the proportional result nationally.

         Sub-types of mixed electoral systems.

         COEXISTENCE: This is a system in which some districts use a
         majoritarian formula, while others employ a proportional formula
         in a single electoral segment (tier). Coexistence systems are
         independent mixed systems.

         SUPERPOSITION: This is a system in which a majoritarian and
         proportional formula are applied in independent electoral
         districts.

         FUSION: This is a system in which majoritarian and proportional
         formulas are used in an independent manner within a single
         district.

         CORRECTION: This is a system in which seats distributed by
         proportional representation in one set of districts are used to
         correct the distortions created by the majoritarian formula in
         another. Correction systems are a dependent form of mixed system.

         CONDITIONAL: This is a system in which the actual use or not of
         one electoral formula depends on the outcome produced by the
         other. Conditional systems are a dependent form of mixed system.

         |
         | The Austrian electoral system consists of three overlapping
         | tiers. The first tier is made of 39 regional electoral
         | districts, the second tier of 9 Land or state level electoral
         | districts and the third tier of one nation-wide electoral
         | district. The number of seats allotted to each Land ahead of an
         | election depends on its census number of resident citizens plus
         | registered Austrian expatriates. The Hare electoral quota used
         | for seat allocation both in the first and second tier is
         | calculated at the level of the second tier. In each Land the
         | electoral quota is calculated from the number of allotted seats
         | divided by the number of valid votes cast. The electoral quota
         | thus varies by Land and the same quota is applied to the first
         | tier seat allocation in the Land's regional electoral districts.
         | Seats allocated (and votes used up) in the first tier are
         | subtracted from the number of seats (and votes) available for
         | subsequent second tier allocation. The number of seats available
         | for third tier allocation is 183 minus the number of seats
         | distributed during first and second tier allocation. The same
         | rule determines the number of remaining votes available for
         | third tier allocation. Participation in second and third tier
         | seat allocation is restricted to parties that have gained at
         | least one first tier seat or a minimum of 4% of valid votes
         | nation-wide. Seat allocation in the third tier is through the
         | D'Hondt divisor rule.

         | For parliamentary elections, Finland is divided into 13

         | within Finland, the number of constituencies was reduced to 
         | 13 (from 15) at the election of 2015. There are in total 200
         | MPs. The number of MPs per constituency is decided before 
         | each election based on the number of inhabitants in each 
         | constituency. In the Parliamentary election of 2015, the 
         | number of MPs on the mainland constituencies varied between 
         | 7 (in the constituency of Lapland) and 35 (Uusimaa). Of the 
         | 200 MPs, 199 are elected in mainland Finland. Moreover, the

         | in a specified constituency but rather throughout the country at
         | large. These are the State Deputies, whose exact number depends
         | on the total electoral strength of each party.
         | The remaining 50 seats are awarded to the party receiving the
         | largest share of the vote, as a 'premium'.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2011): D5065
         |
         | "The electoral system in Ireland is a proportional
         | representation single transferable vote system (PRSTV). Voters
         | put a '1' beside their most preferred candidate, a '2' beside
         | their second most preferred candidate, and so on. Voters can
         | express as many preferences as there are candidates running in
         | their constituency. On the first count, candidates are declared
         | elected if they attract enough first preference votes to pass a
         | specified threshold, which is defined separately for each
         | constituency according to the formula: [total valid votes/
         | (total number of seats +1) +1]. If a candidate is declared
         | elected on the first count, the second preferences of the
         | candidate's surplus votes (i.e., votes over and above the
         | threshold) are then distributed among the other candidates. If
         | this redistribution does not push any of the remaining
         | candidates over the threshold, the candidate with the lowest
         | number of votes is eliminated, then the second preferences of
         | the eliminated candidate's votes are redistributed. This process
         | of redistribution of surpluses and elimination of candidates
         | continues until all the seats in a given constituency are
         | filled. (For details, see Gallagher et al., 2003, Codebook 
         | Part 1).
         |
         | Owing to the quota formula: [total valid votes/(total number
         | of seats "+1") +1], the STV system in Ireland works similarly
         | as the party-list proportional representation which uses
         | the largest-reminder method with droop quota. Consequently,
         | D5065 of IRL_2007 is coded as 32.
         |
         | Because Ireland uses STV instead of PR, there are non-trivial
         | differences between the electoral system of Ireland and the
         | other countries with the PR, for example, "residual" votes go
         | to the next preferred candidates in the STV but in the PR to
         | the next listed/ranked candidates, even though both systems
         | employ "droop" quota for the seats allocation.

         | by lists eligible for seats by the number of seats on offer plus
         | one (i.e.: 150+1=151). The number of votes polled by each party

         | (with any fractional remainder is disregarded) and this gives 
         | the number of seats each party is entitled to. Any seats that 
         | remain unallocated after the application of this procedure

         | The average district magnitude in Germany is liable to change

         | not. Without compensatory seats, the value is 18.69, which is
         | the value the CSES data reflects.
         | In the 2013 election, there were 33 compensatory seats (the
         | total membership of the 2013 Bundestag was 631). Including these
         | compensatory mandates in the district magnitude calculation
         | results in the estimate of district magnitude rising to 20.75.

         | Number of seats allocated above the first tier is variable. 
         | Theoretically it is possible that no seat is allocated above 
         | the first tier. After the 2012 election, 154 seats were 
         | allocated above the first tier. There were 75 seats allocated

D5074       >>> FUSED VOTE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This indicates whether a fused vote was used for presidential and
         legislative elections. A fused vote is when a citizen casts a
         single ballot for the elections of more than one political office.
         This particular variable captures when the single ballot is for
         the presidency and the legislature. Citizens are unable to divide
         their votes among the candidates or lists of different parties.
         Split-ticket voting is expressly prohibited.

         | While voters in Argentina can cast a fused vote, Argentine
         | election law considers each election (the presidential
         | and legislative elections) to be a separate choice and thus a 
         | voter casting a fused ballot is considered to have made two 
         | individual choices. According to the Argentine collaborator,  
         | voters and can regularly do split their votes by physically
         | cutting their ballot paper in half and thus combining a

         before election  (T-1), and two years before election (T-2).

         Definition: The human development index (HDI) is a composite index
         that measures the average achievements in a country in three basic
         dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life; access
         to knowledge; and a decent standard of living. These basic
         dimensions are measured by life expectancy at birth, adult
         literacy and combined gross enrollment in primary, secondary and
         tertiary level education, and gross domestic product (GDP) per
         capita in Purchasing Power Parity US dollars (PPP US$),
         respectively.

         minus the number of emigrants and dividing by the person/years 
         lived by the population of the receiving country over that period.
         A positive value represents more people entering the country than

         Definition: Debt is the entire stock of direct government
         fixed-term contractual obligations to others outstanding on a
         particular date. It includes domestic and foreign liabilities
         such as currency and money deposits, securities other than
         shares, and loans. It is the gross amount of government
         liabilities reduced by the amount of equity and financial
         derivatives held by the government. Because debt is a stock
         rather than a flow, it is measured as of a given date, usually the
         last day of the fiscal year.

         |
         | The Bundesrat is not a second chamber formally since it is
         | indirectly elected, but it is functionally because of its policy
         | implications. Hence, Germany is treated as a two-chamber system.
         | Individual elections in the 16 Laender (States) determine the
         | composition of each Land assembly (Landtag). Each Landtag elects
         | a Land government which then sends its members as delegates to
         | the Bundesrat.

         | Calculating the effective number of electoral parties in 
         | Argentina is complex given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the 
         | following approach: 
         |    - Parties and alliances are treated as one party/grouping.
         |    - Only parties contesting seats in the 2015 election are 
         |      counted. Parties not contesting but who held holdover seats
         |      in parliament are not included in the estimate. 
         |    - While 158 parties are estimated to have fielded candidates
         |      in the election, the number of parties competing reduces to
         |      20 if coalitions are counted as one grouping.

         | Calculating the effective number of parliamentary parties in 
         | Argentina is complex given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the 
         | following approach: 
         |    - Parties and alliances are treated as one party/grouping.
         |    - All parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies post the
         |      2015 elections are included in the count, including parties 
         |      /groupings that held holdover seats but did not contest/or
         |      win additional Chamber of Deputy seats in 2015. 
         |    - The number of parties/alliances represented in the Chamber

         These variables contain the party identification codes from the
         Parliaments and Government Database (ParlGov) project. Codes are
         provided for parties that are assigned an alphabetical code (A-I)
         by the CSES and for polities, for which ParlGov identifiers are
         available.
         
         The complete list of parties (A-I) and their ParlGov codes are 
         detailed in Part 3 of the Codebook.     
 
         The ParlGov party codes were retrieved from the projects website,
         available at:
