         | This eight-character variable uniquely identifies an election
         | study within the CSES.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, variable A1006
         | (CSES polity code) and A1008 (election year).
         |
         | The first three characters are the numeric version of the
         | country codes created by the United Nations Statistics Division
         | ("Countries or areas, codes and abbreviations", revised
         | 13 February 2002).
         |
         | The fourth character distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single country, for the same election.
         | The only example of this to be found in CSES Module 1 is 
         | Belgium, which had a Flanders study (coded 1) and a Walloon
         | study (coded 2). All other election studies in CSES Module 1

         | Post-Election Study (1=postal new sample): Respondents to
         | the post election survey were randomly selected from the 1996
         | electoral roll and sent a self completion questionnaire.
         |
         | Maori Sample (1=postal new sample): As part of the post-election
         | survey, persons on the Maori roll were oversampled allowing for
         | an analysis of Maori political attitudes and behaviour. Persons
         | randomly selected from the Maori electoral rolls were mailed
         | self-administered questionnaires.
         |
         | Panel Study (2 = postal panel from 1993 and 1990): Each elector
         | survey includes a panel of respondents carried through from the
         | previous study, making it possible to track patterns of
         | individual-level change. The 1996 survey includes the final wave
         | of a panel of respondents who participated in the 1993 and 1990
         | NZES.
         |
         | The Campaign Wave (6 = postal campaign): A pre-election survey
         | was conducted over the course of the campaign to track short-
         | term changes in voting behaviour. The rolling cross section was
         | conducted 5 September through 11 October, during which time
         | approximately 120 computer-assisted telephone interviews per
         | day were conducted with randomly selected New Zealanders of
         | voting age. Respondents' names and addresses were also requested
         | and those who supplied them were sent a postal questionnaire
         | after the election.
         |
         | The post-election wave of the campaign sample was added to the
         | post-election sample from the electoral rolls, the Maori sample
         | and the panel and these components comprise the complete post-
         | election data set.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         | NOTES:
         |
         | These variables report the original weights provided with the
         | survey data by the deposit.
         |
         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics so that it more closely resembles
         | the characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the official
         | vote counts.
         |
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that is
         | a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables.  Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of their individual research question.  We
         | recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation before
         | applying them.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights.  To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is not available, these
         | variables are coded 1.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - A1010_1 to A1010_3
         |
         | Users should note that there are several cases in which
         | individual weights (A1010-A1014) for CSES Module 1 are equal to
         | 0.
         | This is evident in Spain (1 record), Netherlands (287 records),
         | and Belgium-Walloon (447 records).
         | This seems to have has occurred because some of the data used to
         | calculate the weights were unavailable for some of the
         | respondents. Those respondents with missing data in the
         | components had their weights set to zero.
         | Because this was a collaborator decision and the weights appear
         | this way in the original data deposits, no change was made by the
         | CSES staff.


         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (1999): A1010-A1012
         |
         | The BELGIUM-FLANDERS (1999) election study provides both a
         | demographic weight and a political weight.  Note that the
         | political weight incorporates demographic corrections, as
         | discussed below.
         |
         | The following advice is provided by the collaborators in
         | Belgium-Flanders with regards to weighting:
         |
         | "In order to compensate for non responses, data can be
         | post-stratified.  Adjustments are used to give different weights
         | to weighting classes in the sample to compensate for the
         | different non-response rates.
         |
         | This dataset contains two weighting coefficients. The first
         | weighting coefficient is based on the distribution of
         | age*gender*education and is displayed by Table [1]. For the
         | calculation of this weighting coefficient, the variables R2
         | (gender, 2 categories), AGE6 (age, 6 categories) and EDUC5
         | (education level, 5 categories) were used. The second
         | coefficient is based on the age*gender*education*voting
         | behavior 1999 marginal distribution. We used R2 (gender, 2
         | categories), AGE6 (age, 6 categories), EDUC4 (education level,
         | 4 categories) and VOT99 (voting behavior 1999, 6 categories) .
         |
         | Different methods can be used to generate weights.  The method
         | used by the ISPO is a population-based method in which
         | information on population subclasses is used to calculate
         | weighting coefficients.  More specifically, four variables are
         | used for post-stratification: age, gender, education and voting
         | behavior in the 1999 General Election.  Since the joint
         | distribution of these four variables in the population is not
         | known, we use IPF (Iterative Proportional Fitting), a technique
         | that uses all available information of known population
         | distributions and known sample information.  The idea behind
         | this method is to make the marginal distributions of the
         | stratification variables conform with the population marginal
         | distributions without distorting the pattern of the joint sample
         | distribution .
         |
         | As is well known, there are various debates on the use of
         | coefficients.  The user him or herself should decide whether or
         | not to use the weighting coefficients.  The use of weights
         | depends very much on the nature and the purpose of the analysis.
         | If used, it is strongly recommended to apply the weighting
         | adjustments with care and to interpret the findings with
         | caution" (Meersseman, et al. (2001). "1999 General Election
         | Study of Flanders-Belgium; Codebook: Questions and Frequency
         | Tables."  K.U., Leuven: Interuniversity Centre for Public

         | 2. Quebec;
         | 3. Ontario;
         | 4. the Midwest (Manitoba and Saskatchewan);
         | 5. the West (Alberta and British Columbia); and
         | 6. the Territories.
         |
         | Smaller provinces and the territories were, relative to their
         | population, over-represented in the sample. The
         | overrepresentation of the smaller provinces facilitates
         | comparison between the six regions. A minimum of 400 interviews
         | were allocated to each region, with a larger allocation of
         | sample going to the larger regions/ provinces.  The sample was
         | distributed equally among the provinces when there was more than
         | one province in the region.  For example, the 400 cases in the
         | Atlantic region were equally distributed among the provinces of
         | Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia and New
         | Brunswick.  Unlike Ontario, Quebec was not under-represented in
         | the sample.  The larger sample for Quebec (relative to Ontario)
         | ensures enough observations in Quebec so that attitudes towards
         | separation can be factored into analysis. Because the sample
         | distribution is not proportional to the population of the
         | provinces and territories, the data must be weighted before
         | national estimates are derived... The weights are calculated by
         | dividing the province or territories or territories' proportion
         | of the households in the sample.  Ontario has the largest weight
         | (1.5) as the province has 36 percent of Canada's households, but
         | only 24 percent of the sample. In preparing national estimates
         | each Ontario case will count for 1.5 observations in the
         | weighted data set; that is, Ontario is "weighted up" so that the
         | impact of the Ontario sample on national estimates is an
         | accurate reflection of Ontario's proportion of the number of
         | households in Canada. Conversely, for provinces or territories
         | where the weights are very small, for example PEI (.1736) and
         | the Northwest Territories (.0653), the proportion of the sample
         | allocated to the province or territory was greater than that
         | province or territories' proportion of the population. As a
         | result, each case is "weighted down."
         |
         | Random Digit Dialing methods were used to identify households
         | for inclusion in the survey by randomly generating residential
         | telephone numbers.  Within households, respondents were randomly
         | selected using the "next birthday" method.  Note, "the
         | probability of an adult member of the household being selected
         | for an interview varies inversely with the number of people
         | living in that household (in a household with only one adult,
         | that adult has a 100 percent chance of selection, in a two adult
         | household each adult has a 50 percent chance of selection,
         | etc.). As a result, it is possible that analyses based on
         | unweighted estimates are biased, as one adult households are
         | over-represented, and larger households are under-represented in
         | the data set."

         |
         | The JAPAN (1996) election study provides a sample weight.
         |
         | From the election study documentation:
         |
         | The weight to correct for sampling bias is generated by the
         | following steps:
         |
         | 1) For each stratum, an adjusted target sample size is
         | calculated by multiplying the original sample size by the
         | overall response rate.  Take the Hokkaido/13 Metropolitan Cities
         | stratum as an example.  The adjusted target sample is 21.19762
         | (29 x 1,535 / 2,100) (See table below).
         |
         | 2) The weight, then, is a factor that adjusts the actual to the
         | adjusted target sample size.  For the same strata, the weight is
         | 1.009410 (21.19762 / 21).
         |
         | 3) In the SPSS weight data set (cese96JPv2 weight.sav), each
         | respondent receives a weight value that corresponds with the
         | stratum to which the respondent belongs.

         |
         | The MEXICO (1997) election study contained a weight that
         | corrected for both sample and demographics.
         |
         | From "Description of Sample and Data Collection":
         |
         | a)  Are the data weighted?  Yes _X__     No ___  If yes:
         | b)  Are the data weighted to compensate for disproportionate
         |     probability  of selection at the person or household
         |     level?  Yes ___     No _X__
         | c)  Are the data weighted to match known demographic
         |     characteristics  of the population?  Yes _X__    No ___
         | d)  Are the data weighted to correct for non-response?
         |     Yes _X__    No ___
         |
         | The weight is the inverse of the probability of selection of
         | the respondent, adjusted by the non-response rate, using
         | quotas by sex and age.

         | The MEXICO (2000) election study contains a weight that
         | corrects for both sample (non-response) and demographics
         | (gender and age) according to 1995 sample estimates.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998): A1010-A1012
         |
         | The NETHERLANDS (1998) election study provides a demographic-
         | political correction, and a sample weight.  A third weight
         | that corrects for the rolling cross-section design of the
         | pre-election study is also available, but is not included in
         | this data file.
         |
         | The weighting variable was provided by Statistics Netherlands,
         | and constructed by means of the Bascula program. This weight is
         | explored and defended in (Schmeets & Molin 1990) and
         | (CBS 1992a). The weight ('model 4') is based upon actual voting
         | behavior (including non-voting) , age group (18-24; 25-34; 35-44;
         | 45-54; 55-64; 65-74; 75 and older), sex, marital status
         | (married; divorced; widow(er); not-married), degree of
         | urbanization (see V0013) and region (see V0010). In the original
         | weighing factor M4 household size was taken into account
         | (Schmeets & Molin 1992: 13 and 23), however, because a sample of
         | persons instead of households was used, this correction was not
         | performed in the construction of this weight. Since the CBS
         | weight is partly based on electoral behavior, it can only be
         | computed for those respondents about whom information on their
         | electoral behavior is available, i.e. the respondents in the
         | post-election wave of interviews. The minimum value of weight 1
         | is of course 0, the maximum value is 3,75. The variance is
         | 0.473. The mean is 0.86, due to the fact that first wave
         | respondents not participating in the second wave are not
         | included (weight = 0).
         |
         | Simple post-stratification weight:
         |
         | The simple post-stratification weight only adjusts for flaws in
         | the net pre-election sample when compared to the desired number
         | of sample units according to the stratification table, Table 11
         | (shown below). Table 11 contains 18 non-empty cells, so that
         | this variable has only 18 distinct values.  For computing these
         | weights, Statistics Netherlands provided a table with the
         | population figures of persons aged 18 and over for all
         | Netherlands municipalities, on January 1, 1998. On the basis
         | of this table, the number of enfranchised persons in each cell
         | of the stratification table could be computed*.  The realized
         | number of pre-election interviews (refer to Table 11) should
         | ideally have an identical distribution over the cells of the
         | table. However, the actual numbers of successful pre-election
         | interviews in the cells of the table deviate, and this variable
         | can be used to correct for this deviation (and this deviation
         | only). Each respondent was assigned a value this variable
         | depending on the cell of Table 11 this respondent belongs to,
         | and according to the formula:
         |
         | (population aged 18 and over in cell)   (total respondents)
         | ------------------------------------- X ---------------------
         | (total population aged 18 and over)     (respondents in cell)
         |
         | Thus computed, this variable has a minimum value of .47, a
         | maximum value of 2.12, and its variance is .008. Its mean value,
         | of course, is 1.
         |
         | * Not all persons aged 18 and over in a municipality are
         | enfranchised: e.g., foreigners and persons in mental
         | institutions are not. The potential bias that might have
         | resulted from an non-uniform distribution of adults without the
         | right to vote over the stratification table, was ignored.
         |
         | The cells in the table below report:
         |
         |         A.  # inhabitants (Dec. 1997)
         |         B.  # units in gross sample
         |         C.  # units to be interviewed
         |         D.  # interviews (1st wave)
         |
         | "CATEG." (category) implies the degree of urbanization, where 1
         | is the highest degree of urbanization.

         |
         | The NEW ZEALAND (1996) election study provided a weight that
         | corrects for both sample and politics.
         |
         | "The New Zealand sample in the CSES is made up of three
         | components: first, a 'new sample' coded 1 in A1007. This was
         | sampled from the electoral rolls but contains an over sample
         | from the 5 Maori electorates.  Second, a panel, containing
         | persons sampled over one or both of the two previous elections
         | (2 in A1007). Finally, persons sampled by randomly selected
         | telephone numbers and random respondent selection within the
         | household (6 in A1007).
         |
         | A1010 first weights correct the effects of the Maori
         | over-sample, and by household size to prevent a bias
         | toward persons in smaller households. It then weights by party
         | vote and non-vote across the three A1007 codes.
         |
         | A simpler weight correcting the oversample in A1007=1 and for
         | household size in A1007=6 can be obtained on request from the

         |
         | This weight was created for the primary purpose of correcting

         | election (i.e. in early January, 2000).  However, some of the

         | The Portuguese questionnaire was administered between the 23rd
         | of March and the 8th of April 2002. For this variable, it was
         | necessary to choose between one of the two months in which the
         | questionnaire was administered.  It was decided to choose the
         | month when the questionnaire started to be administered, i.e.
         | March.
         |
         | The day on which each questionnaire was administered is not
         | available.
         | 
         | Please note that the Portuguese election study was administered
         | after the general data collection phase of CSES Module 1 
         | (1996-2001). However, as the data were deposited in time for 
         | processing and publication with the full release, they have been
         | included in Module 1. Note that the CSES Module 2 questions were 
         | also included in this election study. Hence Portugal (2002) 
         | appears in both modules.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HUNGARY (1998): A2003
         |
         | Completed primary education means that the respondent completed
         | at least the 8 years of primary school (altalanos iskola)
         | education. Respondents with some completed primary education
         | and some post-primary vocational training (but no secondary
         | education as defined below) were coded as if they only completed
         | primary education.
         |
         | Secondary education was defined as studies leading to a maturity
         | exam. Completed secondary education means that the respondent
         | completed his or her studies and passed the maturity
         | ("erettsegi") exam. Passing this exam is a necessary
         | precondition for enrollment in college or university (i.e. in
         | studies leading to BA, MA, BSc, MSc, and equivalent degrees).

         | Netherlands annotation provided to CSES: In the Netherlands
         | educational system, an early choice is made between university-
         | track and non-university track secondary education, which
         | results in the large number of respondents in the CSES category
         | 'incomplete secondary'. These people did complete secondary
         | education, but it does not give them access to a university.
         | Also, there is a strict divide between degree-granting
         | universities and non-degree-granting forms of higher education,
         | which results in a large number of persons in the
         | 'post-secondary trade/vocational school' category.

         | is, the job at which the respondent spends most of the time or
         | if the respondent spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it
         | is the one from which the respondent earns the most money. For
         | respondents who are currently employed, this variable reports
         | their current occupation. For respondents who are retired or not
         | currently working, code last occupation.

         | A2008 and A2011 were derived from H5OCC (User's Guide,
         | pp.90-92) and J14 (pp. 102-103), respectively.
         |
         | Respondent's occupation (H5OCC) and spouse's occupation (J14)
         | were coded to the first two digits (i.e. the "major groups") of
         | the "Australian Standard Classification of Occupations, Second
         | Edition" (ASCO2) (available at http://www.abs.gov.au/ under "ABS
         | Classifications").  (See Attachment B)
         |
         | For A2008 and A2011, the ASCO2 codes have been converted to
         | ISCO-88.  Because the AES96 did not elicit information on the
         | "chief wage earner's" occupation, A2011 codes refer only to the
         | occupational status of the "husband", "wife", or "de facto" of
         | respondents with codes 0-3 on A2004.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (1997): A2017
         |
         | Respondents with no religion were coded 81 ('Agnostic') if they
         | were coded 3 or 4 in variable A2016 and 82 ('Atheist') if
         | they were coded 0,3,4,8 or 9 in variable A2016.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HUNGARY (1998): A2017
         |
         | The data come from the pre-election wave of the survey. The
         | respondents were first asked to name the denomination - if any -
         | in which they were baptized or registered at birth. This was
         | followed by the question on church attendance (see responses at
         | variable A2015 in the CSES micro data). Then, the following
         | question was asked (listed according to the coding of response
         | categories in the integrated CSES micro data set):
         |
         | "And irrespectively of whether you were baptized [registered in
         | a church] at birth, would you say that you currently belong to
         | a religious denomination?"

         | Code 37 indicates religious category "Druse."

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998): A2017
         |
         | Code 91 includes cases within various Reformed Church or
         | Calvinist denominations (but not Presbyterian).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (1997): A2017
         |
         | Religious denomination is not relevant in Norway, and as a
         | result this question was not included in the Norwegian study.
         | However, in 1993, the Norwegian Election Study found 95.5% of
         | respondents were Lutheran Protestants (The Church of Norway).
         | CSES response category, 02., therefore, indicates "Lutheran
         | Protestant" for Norwegian respondents (all respondents were
         | classified as Lutheran Protestants by the collaborator).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2002): A2017
         |
         | Since, in Portugal, most people who consider themselves
         | religious are Catholic, for this question respondents only had
         | three possible answers:
         |
         | CSES Code, Election Study Category/Categories:
         |        01.         Catholic
         |        02.         Other religion
         |        03.         No religion
         |
         | In order to deposit the values in the CSES dataset, the category
         | "other religion" in the Portuguese questionnaire corresponds to
         | the CSES category 80, "other religions". However, while in the
         | Portuguese case "other religion" means all except the Catholic
         | religion, in the CSES case it means other religions beside all
         | those listed before.

         | As only a few people in Portugal do not speak Portuguese at
         | home, this question was phrased thus (translating from
         | Portuguese to English):
         |
         | Do you generally speak Portuguese at home?
         | 1. Yes
         | 2. No
         |
         | As there is no "other languages" CSES category in this variable,
         | respondents who speak another language than Portuguese have been
         | coded as "missing".

         | the collaborator.  However, 9 of the 10 respondents included in
         | this category identify with the Roma ethnicity (the remaining
         | individual identifies with the Hungarian ethnicity). Therefore,
         | it is likely that the response category corresponding to code
         | 227 indicates a dialect of Romany that does not fit into the
         | CSES classification scheme.  This will be confirmed as more
         | information becomes available.

A2019    >>> REGION OF RESIDENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This variable reports the respondents' region of residence using
         coding categories not more detailed than the autonomous regions in
         Spain, or the Laender in Germany. Regions are usually (but not
         always) based upon the social, cultural, or historical differences
         (though some correspond to administrative regions) that manifest
         themselves in political cleavages.

         | This variable was derived from AES variable ELECT (respondent's
         | Electoral Division) (User's Guide, pp. 105-108).
         |
         | State of residence remains the most socially meaningful regional
         | indicator for the Australian (federal) polity.  The
         | geographically peripheral states of Queensland, Western
         | Australia, and Tasmania have, for example, demonstrated
         | distinctive patterns of support for minor parties in recent
         | years, with the "Greens" gaining the election of four members to
         | the House of Assembly in Tasmania and three to the Legislative
         | Council in Western Australia.  Moreover, in conjunction with
         | variable A2022, and/or with variable A2027, A2019 may be
         | heuristic with regard to sub-regional differences in issue
         | orientation, as well as in party support (e.g. as between
         | Northern Queensland and metropolitan Brisbane).

         | Although Hungarian public discourse occasionally refers to the
         | "North-West", "Budapest", the "East", or particular counties as
         | regions that display some cultural, economic, historical and
         | political differences, the number, identity and boundaries of
         | the relevant regions is rather obscure, and, at the very least,
         | have been constantly changing.  Therefore, the construction of
         | this variable is based on the multimember electoral district of
         | the respondent's residence. These are the 19 counties and the
         | capital city of Budapest, which also serve as the twenty
         | administrative units of Hungary that exist between the national
         | and municipal level. For this variable these twenty multimember

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (1997): A2020

         |
         | Anthropologists may question whether the Roma belongs to a
         | different race than other Hungarian citizens, but in political
         | terms the "Roma question" of Hungarian domestic politics has
         | racial, rather than ethnic overtones. Thus, the potentially
         | relevant distinction between Roma and non-Roma is retained by
         | the race variable. The interviewers were asked to record, right
         | after the post-election interview, whether the respondent was or
         | was not Roma, or that they cannot tell. Based on the presumed
         | historical origin of the Roma people, respondents believed by
         | the interviewers to be Roma were coded as members of the Indian
         | race. Due to the insignificant frequency of exceptions,
         | respondents believed by the interviewers not to be Roma were
         | coded Caucasoid.

         | Race is not asked in the Japanese survey. Code 02 (Asian) was
         | assigned to all respondents by the collaborator.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (1996): A2020
         |
         | Response category "10. Other: Country specific"  was
         | incorporated for New Zealand to accommodate respondents in New
         | Zealand who said that they were "New Zealanders".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2002): A2020
         |
         | Questions concerning race are deemed inappropriate in Portuguese
         | society.  Instead, the interviewer was asked to guess the
         | respondent's race. Therefore there are no answers in categories
         | "don't know" or "refused to answer".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (1996): A2020,A2021
         |
         | The category "Asian/Pacific Islander" in the U.S. study was
         | recoded to the CSES "Asian" category.  Also, note this US
         | response category includes all ethnic identities corresponding
         | to the Polynesian, Micronesian, Melanesian CSES response
         | category.  As a result, American Rs corresponding to these
         | ethnic identities cannot be identified, and are reported under
         | the broad CSES response category "Asian."
         |
         | Also, the race of respondent (variable A2020) was determined
         | by the interviewer, while the R's ethnic identity (variable
         | A2021) was reported by the respondent.

A3015    >>> RECALL CANDIDATES FROM LAST ELECTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Q6. Do you happen to remember the name of any candidates who [ran/
         stood] in your [lower house primary electoral district, e.g.,
         constituency, district, riding] in the last [parliamentary/
         congressional] election?
         ..................................................................

             1. YES
             5. NO
             6. INCONSISTENT RESPONSE: YES; NO CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED
             7. INCONSISTENT RESPONSE: NO; CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED

             8. DON'T KNOW
             9. MISSING

             0. NOT APPLICABLE

         | NOTES: A3015
         |
         | Respondents who only identified party of candidate (without
         | name) have not been coded for recall in either the candidate or
         | party variables in the CSES data.
         |
         | Explanatory analyses of recalled candidates by party and gender
         | for each country revealed several inconsistencies that
         | researchers should keep in mind when using these variables.
         |
         | Some nations in the sample did not provide specific codes for
         | "incorrect" responses.  Two considerations arise as a
         | consequence of this.  First, in those countries that only
         | identified the correct responses in the tally (variable A3019),
         | it is difficult for users to uncover whether this occurred in
         | the first, second, third, or some combination of three recall
         | items for individual respondents. Second, it is unclear in which
         | cases respondents who gave incorrect responses were coded "don't
         | know" or "missing."
         |
         | In some countries, there occurred a relatively small amount of
         | cases in which candidates' party and gender were coded
         | inconsistently, and may be due to data entry errors and/or
         | disagreement over which party a candidate is affiliated with if
         | s/he were endorsed by multiple parties or is a member of a
         | party that is a member of a larger bloc.  This is evident in
         | Hungary, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan.
         |
         | The general procedure for asking this question was that
         | respondents were initially asked if they remembered any
         | candidates (variable A3015).  If they replied "yes,"
         | respondents were asked to name up to three candidates that they
         | remembered.  The party and gender of the candidate were assigned
         | later by the interviewer or during the data entry process.  In
         | some countries, however, respondents were asked to identify the
         | candidates by party and gender.  In this case, if a candidate's
         | name was recalled correctly, but corresponding party and/or
         | gender were incorrectly recalled, then variables A3017_1,
         | A3017_2, and A3017_3 were coded "0" and variables A3018_1,
         | A3018_2, and A3018_3 were coded "99" OR the incorrect gender
         | and/or party were coded although correct information is
         | technically accessible to the researcher. These variables have
         | been left as they are since they are possibly valuable as a
         | source of information about candidate recognizability and degree
         | of political information held by respondents.  Countries
         | involved are Belarus, Czech Republic, Norway, Peru, Poland,
         | Romania, and Ukraine.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (1996): A3015-A3016_3
         |
         | Respondents were asked (Questionnaire, p.9): "Before the
         | election, did you know the name of your local Federal MP in the
         | House of Representatives, and his or her political party? (Write
         | in name and party if you recall them, otherwise circle 9)"
         | (C.4).
         |
         | Respondents who wrote in the name of the Federal MP, and were
         | coded as "name given" on C4NAME, were coded as "yes" on A3015;
         | those who "Didn't know name" of their MP were coded as "no".
         |
         | Codes 001 to 146 on A3016_1-A3016_3 refer
         | to the names of the Federal MP for each of the 146 electoral
         | divisions that remained intact after the 1996 election (the two
         | new electoral divisions, of Namadgi and Longman, did not, of
         | course, have a MP before the election).  Respondents coded as
         | "yes" on A3015 were assigned the code of the MP from the
         | respondent's electoral division, because the names that they had
         | written were not recorded.  Respondents residing in Namadgi and
         | Longman were declared "missing" on A3016_1, A3017_1, and A3018_1
         | and coded as "0" on A3019.  Respondents who were coded as "no"
         | on A3015 and those who were "missing" on C4NAME were coded as
         | "not applicable" on A3016_1.
         |
         | Federal MPs Phil Cleary and Edward Mack represented their
         | electorates of North Sydney (Div. Number 134) and Wills (Div.
         | Number 237), respectively, as "Independent" of any party.
         | Accordingly, respondents from these divisions (coded "yes" on
         | A3015) were coded as "Other" on A3018_1.

         | question. "If you remember the names of the candidates who run

         | please specify their names.  Are there any others? (O.A.-M.A.)"

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (1996): A3015-A3019
         |
         | The question of whether R recalled any candidates in their lower
         | house electoral district was never answered by respondents as
         | no.  Respondents either indicated yes or did not answer.  There
         | were 710 cases of missing data which were recoded as "no" which
         | may blur the line between no recall and missing data.  Yet it
         | appears, the self-administered mode of the questionnaire and the
         | question content lend itself to non-response in cases where
         | respondents do not recall candidates, hence the recode.

         |
         | The candidates' names are recorded.  Shortly, the CSES staff
         | hope to make available the
         | corresponding gender and party affiliations of these candidates.
         | In the meantime, for A3016, response category  1'
         | indicates that the respondent identified a candidate; response
         | category  0' indicates that while the respondent indicated that
         | they were able to recall candidates, they did not.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (1996): A3015-A3018
         |
         | Note that the "candidate-recall" question wording differs
         | slightly: "Do you happen to remember the names of the candidates
         | for Congress - that is, for the House of Representatives in
         | Washington - who are running in the November election from this
         | district?" "Who were they?" "What is [NAME'S] party?"
         |
         | Note also that this question was administered in the pre-
         | election study.
         |
         | In many instances, respondents who answered "Yes" were then
         | unable to provide any name (Don't Know) or only provided names
         | which were not recognized names of candidates from their
         | district.  In the latter cases, such names were usually
         | recollected names for candidates/officeholders from other
         | offices (not the House of Representatives) or other erroneous
         | recall. In a few instances, an unknown name may actually have
         | been that of an unknown write-in or other type of minor party/
         | independent candidate, however, unless a minor party/independent
         | candidate had his or her name on the Candidate List for the
         | respondent's Congressional district, the name was unknown and
         | coded "97 Name not on Candidate List for this office". (In the
         | summary variable A3019, cases coded 97 are not counted as
         | 'correct').
         |
         | Further, usually, the Candidate List (list of candidates at the
         | House, Senate and Governor level who ran in the respondent's
         | district, see Appendix III for the list of House candidates from
         | the Candidate List) includes few minor party/independent
         | candidates because minor party candidates typically have few
         | supporters and a very low level of recognizability.  In 1996,
         | no minor party/independent candidate appeared on a Candidate
         | List for any U.S. Congressional district represented in the
         | study.

         | but are correct.
         |
         | (This note was provided with the deposit:) The list contains the
         | names of the first five candidates from the lists of the seven
         | biggest parties in Norway. For the smaller parties - only the
         | first candidate on the list is given a code.
         |
         | If the respondent has recalled correct surname for a candidate
         | on one of the lists, this is coded as correct answer in A3016
         | even though the first name may be incorrect.
         |
         | If a respondent has recalled only a surname and the name is on
         | more than one list in the electoral district, the answer is
         | correct but party and gender is left open.
         |
         | Variable A3016 reports response category 996, if the respondent
         | identified only the surname of a candidate from the list
         | compiled, as described above, and there was more than one
         | candidate with this surname (preventing the collaborator from

         Q7a-f. I'd like to know what you think about each
         of our political parties.  After I read the name of a political
         party, please rate it on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you
         strongly dislike that party and 10 means that you strongly like
         that party.  If I come to a party you haven't heard of or you feel
         you do not know enough about, just say so.  The first party is
         PARTY A.

         | The 0-100 scale used in the Netherlands survey was collapsed for
         | CSES in the following manner:
         |
         | CSES Code, Election Study Category/Categories:
         |
         |        00.         0-5

         | The portion of the Netherlands questionnaire which asked
         | respondents to rate their liking for various parties randomized
         | the order in which the names of the parties were read.  In
         | addition, the portion of the questionnaire which asked
         | respondents to rate their liking for individual political
         | figures randomized the order in which the names of those
         | political figures were read.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ROMANIA (1996): A3020-A3021,A3032
         |
         | The items included in the Romanian study do not correspond very
         | well to the most popular parties, at least partly due to the
         | complex system of electoral alliances that formed during this
         | election (the items included correspond to parties, and not the
         | electoral blocks).  As a result, there is a considerable amount
         | of missing data reported in these variables.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2001): A3020-A3021

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UKRAINE (1998): A3020-A3032

         | There are some inconsistencies in the coding of these items
         | across the various versions of these data provided by the
         | collaborator, especially with regard to the handling of
         | respondents in category 0.  In some versions of the data, these
         | responses are reported in as missing and are assigned code '99'.
         | Because the questionnaire reports that a code 0 was included as
         | a non-missing response category, and because the original
         | frequencies deposited by the collaborator report these
         | respondents in category '0,' they are included in this category
         | in the CSES data files.

         |
         | Please note that the coverage of the 1997 British General
         | Election Study is Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and
         | Scotland) - not the United Kingdom. The percent of the vote
         | was obtained for A5005_A, A5005_B and A5005_C from the UK
         | Electoral Commission. Given that the Commission did not
         | report vote percentages for small parties at the level of
         | Great Britain, we sought alternative sources to supply
         | these statistics. This information was located at:
         | http://www.election.demon.co.uk. Here the results are
         | disaggregated properly for vote share. This site is not an
         | official election site for the UK, but the information
         | found at the UK Electoral Commission in this case was
         | consistent with the alternative site (i.e., the total
         | amount of vote for the SNP and PC is exactly the same -
         | both percentages and number of votes). Thus, we used this
         | source to refill the incomplete data from the UK Electoral
         | Commission (e.g., vote for SNP, vote for PC and voter
         | turnout)

         | The district data regarding the percentage of votes obtained by

         | of these data do not add to the national percentages reported
         | by the same source. We were not able to figure out the method
         | used to add up the district percentages to match the national
         | results.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         In some electoral systems, there are electoral districts that are
         geographically nested but not otherwise related for purposes of
         seat allocation.  In Lithuania, for example, there are 71 single-
         member districts that operate under a majority runoff system, and
         also a single nation-wide district that operates under
         proportional representation (the largest remainders method with
         the Hare quota). Neither votes nor seats from the single-member
         districts transfer to the nationwide district, however. The two
         processes are entirely independent (with voters having one vote in
         each district).  In this case, the nationwide district, although
         it contains the 71 single-member districts, is not considered to
         be secondary. It is primary. One might say that there are two
         segments to the electoral system in such cases.

         | proportion of votes a party receives and their share of the
         | seats in the legislature (i.e. a "corrective tier"). Because the
         | allocation of seats in a corrective tier is not independent of
         | the distribution of votes in a particular segment- in fact, it
         | is this distribution that determines the allocation of seats in
         | the corrective tier- the presence of corrective tiers has no
         | bearing on the number of electoral segments. Only those
         | characteristics of directly elected tiers are reported in these

         | members of local councils, religious representatives, and
         | Congress members from mainland China. Each member casts 10

         | The three possibilities are:
         |
         | A. Two or more parties can nominate the same presidential
         | candidate only if they also agree on a single slate of
         | legislative candidates (in the Chamber of Deputies and in the
         | Senate, both single-member and multi-member districts

         | for the 200 proportional representation seats in the Chamber of
         | Deputies and the 32 proportional seats in the Senate (5 regional
         | multi-member districts in the case of the Chamber of Deputies

         | the 300 simple majority  deputies and the 32 three-member
         | federal districts for the Senate.
         |
         | C. Two or more parties can form a partial alliance to nominate
         | candidates running for the Chamber of Deputies in single-member
         | districts if the number of common candidates postulated is
         | between 33 and 100, otherwise the parties must commit to a total
         | alliance. In the case of the Senate, two or more parties can

         | majority if the number of common candidates postulated is
         | between 6 and 20, otherwise the parties involved must commit to

         | "Apparentment not possible in the strict legal sense used in
         | other countries where it is a kind of temporary combination
         | recognized by law.  The only thing that comes close in NZ is the
         | umbrella party/component party arrangement (e.g. the Alliance,
         | Christian Coalition) but the umbrella party has to be registered
         | in its own right in order to nominate a list.  Although the
         | Christian Coalition no longer exists as a political party, from
         | memory there was a hint of something like apparentement in its
         | respective component parties in Parliament after the election."
         |
         | "... the only kind of joint lists are those of an umbrella
         | party.  Because such a party has to be registered in its own
         | right, all the rules applicable to any registered party also
         | apply to it, e.g. candidate selection, financial disclosure.
         | However an electorate seat won by an electorate candidate
         | standing under the name of a component party counts for the
         | umbrella party for the purpose of crossing the threshold."
         |
         | "Although [it is uncertain whether] it has been tested, an
         | electorate's party name on the ballot paper could possibly
         | reflect multi-party endorsement, e.g. it would be possible for
         | an electorate candidate for an umbrella party to have a party
         | name that combined the names of the umbrella party and the
         | component party (e.g. Alliance/Democrat).  Indeed, a component
         | party could apply for registration in its own right with a party
         | name or abbreviation in that form (again, however, none has ever
         | done so which makes this rather speculative). But there is no
         | requirement that a component party be registered, so an
         | electorate candidate for an unregistered component party who
         | wanted a party name in that form could state it on the
         | nomination paper and it would be up to the Returning Officer and
         | the Chief Electoral Officer to decide as to whether it would be
         | accepted."

         | "Note too that the law does not allow a person to be a
         | candidate on more than one party list at a general election, or

         | In the Upper House elections, in some cases parties refrain from
         | running candidate(s) already on first ballots. In other cases
         | parties withdraw their candidacies in run-offs. Strategic
         | coordination between parties is not limited to Upper House
         | elections alone. Especially in Lower House single-member
         | districts (SMDs) it is quite common that parties fraternally
         | divide upper and lower house seat(s) among them before the
         | election, so that elections are either 'mock' elections (i.e. no
         | prosperous rival candidates), or, in case of perfect
         | coordination, 'tacit' elections (i.e. no rival candidates at
         | all, and thus, no election is held). The latter happened at the
         | 1999 lower house elections and at the 2003 upper house elections
