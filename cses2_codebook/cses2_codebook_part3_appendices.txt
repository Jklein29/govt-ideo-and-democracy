         | NOTES: PARTIES AND LEADERS
         |
         | This appendix identifies parties active during a polity's
         | election and (where available) their leaders.
         |
         | Provided are the party labels for the codes used in the micro
         | data variables. Parties A through F are the six most popular
         | parties, listed in descending order according to their share of
         | the popular vote in the "lowest" level election held (i.e.,
         | wherever possible, the first segment of the lower house).
         |
         | Note that in countries represented with more than a single
         | election study the order of parties may change between the two
         | elections.
         |
         | Leaders A through F are the corresponding party leaders or
         | presidential candidates referred to in the micro data items.
         | This appendix reports these names and party affiliations.
         |
         | Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties and leaders
         | voluntarily provided by some election studies. However, these
         | are in no particular order.

         | Note that in items that code parties from A to F (or I) (e.g.,
         | B3037, B3038, B5011, etc.), Kyrgyz parties are not ordered
         | according to the election returns, but according to their
         | popularity as expressed in the CSES party identification item
         | B3029_1. Kyrgyzstan CSES election study is focused on the early
         | presidential election of July 10, 2005, but the candidates
         | basically did not represent parties that respondents were asked
         | about in the aforementioned items. As a result, the list of the
         | parties is not applicable to the presidential election results
         | items (B5005). These items list election results of the
         | candidates that participated in the presidential election (see
