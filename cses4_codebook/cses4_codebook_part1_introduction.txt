>>> CSES PROJECT PROFILE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative
program of research among election study teams from around the world.
Participating countries include a common module of survey questions
in their post-election studies. The resulting data are deposited along
with voting, demographic, district and macro variables. The studies are
then merged into a single, free, public dataset for use in comparative
study and cross-level analysis.

The CSES project focuses on respondents' behavior and attitudes during 
the time of a national election, with a particular emphasis on voting and 
turnout. Each CSES Module consists of a nationally-representative 
post-election survey and additional variables about the context of the 
overall country and electoral system within which the respondents find 
themselves. Every five years a new CSES Module is designed with a 
different substantive theme selected to address essential questions 
in electoral studies and social science. 

An international committee of leading scholars of electoral politics and 
political science develop the research agenda, questionnaires, and study 
design. The design is implemented in each country by their foremost 
social scientists. By collaborating in this way, the CSES community hopes 
to forward scientific inquiry into the relationship between electoral
institutions and political behavior.

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American National 
Science Foundation, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social 
Sciences, and the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies. 
Details of particular grants that provided funding for Module 4 are 
available under the "HOW TO CITE THE CSES MODULE 4 STUDY". 
The project also receives in-kind support from participating election 
studies, additional organizations that sponsor planning committee 
meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund national 
election studies that participate in CSES. 

This is the fourth iteration of CSES known as CSES Module 4. The remainder
of the project description relates specifically to CSES Module 4.

>>> CSES MODULE 4 STUDY DESCRIPTION - ABSTRACT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSES Module 4 has two themes. The first focused on distributional politics 
and social protection. The goal of the module is to enhance knowledge of 
voter preferences for policies that affect income and wealth distribution, 
in a period of constrained growth, deficit reduction, and expenditure 
constraint and austerity. It draws upon the literature in comparative 
political economy and develops data that will enable scholars to 
understand how political institutions condition voters' reactions 
to the politics of budgetary restraint. The module is influenced by 
the economic crises of the years before its implementation.
The second subtheme focused on mobilization with a battery of questions 
asking respondents about contacts by parties and candidates, and about 
personal contacts intended to influence vote choice.

CSES Module 4 data was collected from 2011 through 2016. 

More information regarding the theme of Module 4 can be found in the
CSES Module 4 Theoretical Statement available on the CSES website.

The CSES project is incredibly grateful to our Module 4 collaborators, who
raised their own funds to include CSES Module 4 in a nationally
representative post-election study in their country or province.

Listed collaborators are those who appear in the Design Report for the
respective study - they are not necessarily the parties who collected
the data, and they are not necessarily the only investigators on each
study. Most election studies benefited from the scientific input and data
preparation skills of additional persons not listed here.

Within each election study, collaborators are presented in the order in
which they are listed in the Design Report deposited by each collaborator
team. The affiliations listed are current as of the date when each
election study's Design Report was deposited with CSES. The polities are
listed in alphabetical order.

>>> THE CSES DATA FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following ZIP files, which contain the CSES data are available to 
download from the CSES Module 4 study page at: 
         http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module4/module4.htm
         
Users can download the data in a variety of formats depending on which 
statistical packages) they intend to use with the data:

  cses4_csv.zip       Contains a CSV file with variables names as column 
                      headers but no additional metadata (for instance,
                      no code labels are included).
                                      
  cses4_syntax.zip    Contains a raw data file and syntax statements to
                      read the dataset into SAS, SPSS, and STATA. The
                      instructions for doing so are found in the 
                      headers of the syntax files for each statistical
                      package: cses4.sas for SAS, cses4.sps for SPSS,
                      and cses4.do for STATA. 
                      
  cses4_r.zip         Contains a R Workplace system file (.rdata), with
                      the dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into R. Missing data statements are not applied.
  
  cses4_sas.zip       Contains a SAS 7-8 system file (.sas7bdat), with
                      the dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into SAS. Missing data statements are not applied.
  
  cses4_spss.zip      Contains a SPSS system file (.sav), with the dataset
                      already prepared and ready to be loaded into SPSS.
                      Missing data statements are not applied.
  
  cses4_stata.zip     Contains a STATA 13 system file (.dta), with the
                      dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into STATA.  Missing data statements are not applied.

Please note that all of the above packages will need a File Extractor 
programme downloaded to their computer to be able to Unzip and open the
above files. 

We recommend that PC users create the following directory on their hard
drive, and to download their files from this Module 4 release to that 
location:
                 "c:/cses/module4/20180529/"

The subdirectory value "20180529" represents the version (release date) of 
the dataset - this being 2018, and the 29 May version of CSES Module 4.
This file structure is compatible with how the "cses4_syntax.zip" file
(detailed above) is organized. The ,method allows users with multiple CSES
datasets and/or versions to stay organized and not over-write their other 
files. Users of other computer types (Macs, Unix, etc.) are recommended to 
use a similar directory structure to organize their CSES files.

For election studies that are embedded in multi-wave panel studies, only
those respondents who participated in the wave of the survey that included
CSES Module 4 are included in the CSES Module 4 dataset.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MICRO-LEVEL (SURVEY) COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core questionnaire ("Module") of CSES Module 4 was intended to be
administered as a single, uninterrupted block of questions in a nationally
representative post-election survey in each country.

(A) The question text is included in the variable documentation of this
    codebook. The questions are reported in the order in which they appear 
    in the CSES questionnaire. For some questions, collaborator 
    instructions for the administration of the CSES Questionnaire were 
    important. These are reported in the next section.

(B) Where there are known differences in the way a particular question was
    administered in an election study, this is noted in the "ELECTION STUDY
    NOTES" following the documentation of the corresponding variable.

(C) There are several sets of party and leader evaluation items included
    in the module. These correspond to parties labeled A-F, in descending
    order of vote share, of the six most popular parties in the lower house
    elections (or presidential elections if legislative elections were not
    held). Where respondents were asked to evaluate other parties, these
    evaluations have been included where possible and are labeled parties
    G-I, regardless of their vote shares. The parties and leaders to which
    these evaluations apply are identified in Part 3 of the Codebook.

(D) There are several questions (including the vote choice and party
    identification items) that ask the respondents to specify a political
    party. The codes for these items are also reported in Codebook Part 3.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES MODULE 4 COLLABORATOR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
    CSES QUESTIONNAIRE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions appeared in the header to the questionnaire for
CSES Module 4, as instructions to collaborators regarding the
implementation of the questionnaire in their respective polity.

( 1) CSES MODULE 4 QUESTIONNAIRE: ADMINISTRATIVE VARIABLES
     The "Administrative Variables" section is a list of common
     administrative variables that, if possible, should be provided at
     the time data are deposited with the CSES Secretariat.

     CSES MODULE 4 QUESTIONNAIRE: CSES MODULE
     This is the CSES Module itself, a common module of survey questions
     for researchers to include in their national post-election survey.
     The CSES Module is intended to be administered exactly as it is
     specified in this document.

     CSES MODULE 4 QUESTIONNAIRE: DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES
     Collaborators are asked to provide data on background (demographic)
     characteristics of respondents, coded to an agreed upon set of
     standards as indicated in this section. There is great international
     variation in the ways that collaborators will go about soliciting
     information on the background characteristics of their respondents.
     The objective here is not standardization of the way collaborators
     ask these background questions, but instead, standardization to a
     common, cross-national scheme for coding each variable.

( 2) The CSES Module is intended to be administered in its entirety as
     a single, uninterrupted block of questions, unless noted otherwise
     for particular questions. In most cases, the CSES Module is
     included as part of a larger study. For reliable comparisons to be
     made, it is important that any additional items investigators may
     wish to include do not interrupt the CSES Module.

( 3) The CSES module should be administered as a post-election
     interview.

( 4) Where the CSES module is included in a larger study, to ensure that
     question-ordering effects are minimized, it is most preferable for
     the CSES Module to be administered at the beginning of the survey
     instrument. Where this is not possible, collaborators should be
     sensitive to the effects questions asked immediately prior to the
     module may have.

( 5) NOTES often precede the question TEXT, and provide instructions for
     the administration of the item. Where no question TEXT is provided,
     collaborators should provide documentation of the question used.

( 6) Show cards may be helpful for the administration of some questions.
     For this reason, a Respondent Booklet is available for download
     from the CSES website. The Respondent Booklet contains show cards
     for select questions. It is indicated in the NOTES when a show card
     is available for a question.

( 7) The response options that should be read to the respondent are
     contained in the body of the question TEXT.

( 8) Where lower-case words appear in brackets [ ] collaborators should
     select the words that are most appropriate.

     For example:
     [party/presidential candidate]
     ...indicates that either the word "party" or the phrase
     "presidential candidate" should be read, but not both.

( 9) Where upper-case words appear in brackets [ ] collaborators should
     substitute the words that are most appropriate.

     For example:
     [COUNTRY]
     ...should be replaced with the name of the country where the
     election was held (perhaps "Canada" or "the Philippines").

     Another example:
     [NUMBER OF YEARS BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND THE PRESENT ELECTION
     OR CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT]
     ...should be replaced with a number that indicates the amount of
     years that have passed between the previous election and either the
     current election or recent change in government.

(10) Phrases that appear in parentheses ( ) contain words that are
     optional - that collaborators (or their interviewers) can decide to
     read or not read to respondents as needed.

(11) Words in question text that are in upper-case but NOT within
     brackets [ ] should be emphasized by the interviewer when reading
     the question text.

     For example, the word "COUNTRY" would be emphasized in the
     following question when the interviewer reads the question to the
     respondent:
          "What COUNTRY do you live in?"

     But in this next example, the interviewer does not emphasize the
     word "[COUNTRY]". Instead, this is an instruction for the
     collaborator to substitute the name of the respondent's country
     into the question text (for more information, see the eighth
     Collaborator Instruction above):
         "How long have you lived in [COUNTRY]?"

(12) Interviewer instructions are available for some questions. These
     interviewer instructions, labeled as HELP, are intended to
     provide advice to the interviewers to assist in administering the
     question. It is also useful to discuss the interviewer instructions
     as part of interviewer training. The interviewer instructions,
     where available, appear after the question TEXT. In interviewer-
     administered surveys, interviewer instructions should be available to
     the interviewer, but not to the respondent. For example, in a computer
     -assisted interview, the interviewer instructions might appear on the
     screen in a special color, and interviewers trained to make use of
     those instructions as necessary, but the interviewer should NOT read
     the interviewer instructions to the respondent.

(13) Some response options are followed by an arrow (->) and a skip
     pattern instruction. If the respondent selects that response
     option, the skip pattern instruction after the arrow is to be
     executed.

(14) Respondents who volunteer the response "DON'T KNOW" (or who have
     REFUSED to answer a question) should be coded as such. Interviewers
     should accept these responses and should NOT probe for additional
     information or force a respondent to use one of the response
     options provided in the text of the question.

(15) Special care should be taken in the administration of the Vote
     Choice items (Q5 and Q6 question series).

     Wording for the Q5 and Q6 question series, which is to record
     vote choice in the elections, should follow national standards.
     Collaborators are invited to compare their own national instrument
     with other instruments of countries that are part of the CSES and
     look for convergence where this is possible.

     For Q6 (previous election), ask about the previous national
     election of the same type (whether legislative or presidential).
     For countries where more than one institution is being currently
     elected on the same day (e.g. president and legislature), please
     consider asking about the previous lower house election if votes
     have been recorded for the current lower house election.

     For Q5 (current election), for countries where more than one
     institution is elected on the same day (e.g., president and
     legislature) using different votes, please ensure that all votes
     are supplied. Consider including all national elections having been
     held within three months before or after the study's data
     collection period.

     Please ensure all vote choices are supplied as separate variables
     in the dataset that you deposit.

     For countries where voters have two votes for the same institution
     (e.g. parallel and mixed member proportional systems; double
     ballot systems), please ensure that both/all votes are supplied.
     For countries using preferential systems (e.g., STV, AV) please
     provide first and second preference vote.

(16) For questions asking about parties, collaborators should be advised
     that they may add one or several party blocs to a list of
     individual parties if they feel that it will be difficult for
     respondents to recognize individual parties.

(17) Collaborators in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems shall
     adhere to the following standards of data quality:

     A) MODE OF INTERVIEWING: 
     Interviews should be conducted face-to-face, unless local 
     circumstances dictate that telephone or mail surveys will produce 
     higher quality data.

     B) TIMING OF INTERVIEWING: 
     We strongly recommend that collaborators in the Comparative Study 
     of Electoral Systems conduct their interviews in the weeks 
     following their national election. Out of concern for data quality, 
     data collection should be completed in as timely a fashion as 
     possible. In the event of a runoff election, interviewing shall be 
     conducted after the first round election. The date of interview 
     shall be provided for each respondent.

     C) PLACEMENT OF MODULE IN POST-ELECTION QUESTIONNAIRE: 
     The questionnaire should be asked as a single, uninterrupted
     block of questions. We leave it to each collaborator to select
     an appropriate location for the module in their national survey
     instrument. Collaborators should take steps to ensure that
     questions asked immediately prior to the questionnaire module
     do not contaminate the initial questions in the module.
     Collaborators are also free to select an appropriate place in
     their survey instrument to ask the turnout, vote choice,
     and demographic questions.

     D) POPULATION TO BE SAMPLED: 
     National samples should be drawn from all age-eligible citizens. 
     When non-citizens (or other non-eligible respondents) are included 
     in the sample, a variable should be provided to permit the 
     identification of those non-eligible respondents. When a 
     collaborator samples from those persons who appear on voter 
     registration lists, the collaborator should quantify the estimated 
     degree of discrepancy between this population and the population 
     of all age-eligible citizens.

     E) SAMPLING PROCEDURES: 
     We strongly encourage the use of random
     samples, with random sampling procedures used at all stages of
     the sampling process. Collaborators should provide detailed
     documentation of their sampling practices.

     F) SAMPLE SIZE: 
     We strongly recommend that no fewer than 1,000 age-eligible 
     respondents be interviewed.

     G) INTERVIEWER TRAINING: 
     Collaborators should pre-test their survey instrument and should 
     train interviewers in the administration of the questionnaire. 
     The Planning Committee will provide each collaborator with 
     documentation that clarifies the purposes and objectives of each 
     item and with rules with respect to probing "don't know" responses.

     H) FIELD PRACTICES: 
     Collaborators should make every effort to ensure a high response rate.
     Investigators should be diligent in their effort to reach respondents
     not interviewed on the initial contact with the household and should
     e diligent in their effort to convert respondents who initially 
     refuse to participate in the study. Data on the number of contact 
     attempts, the number of contacts with sample persons, and special 
     persuasion or conversion efforts undertaken should be coded for 
     each respondent.

     I) TRANSLATION (AND BACK-TRANSLATION): 
     Each collaborator should translate the questionnaire module into 
     their native language(s). To ensure the equivalence of the 
     translation, collaborators shall perform an independent 
     re-translation of the questionnaire back into English. Collaborators
     engaged in translation of the questionnaire module into the same 
     language (e.g., Spanish, French, English, German, and Portuguese) 
     should collaborate  on the translation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DISTRICT-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The district-level variables report the returns of the lower house (first
segment) election for each respondent's district. Wherever possible,
these data were collected from official electoral commissions (see
Bibliography for details). In other cases, CSES has been grateful for the
compilations of these data provided by third-party sources.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MACRO-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To supplement the micro (survey) data, the teams of researchers responsible
for the collection of the public opinion data also compiled and deposited
the following types of data: electoral legislation, political party
platforms, and official electoral returns.

To facilitate this process, a detailed questionnaire was constructed to
serve as a framework for the macro component of the project. The Macro Data
Reports, completed by the CSES collaborators, can be found on the CSES
website in the Module 4 section under the "Data Center".

Additional measures thought pertinent to the micro-district-macro design
are also compiled and available in the CSES data files.

Sources consulted for the macro level component are listed as appropriate
in the Bibliography at the end of this part of the CSES Codebook. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 4 DOCUMENTATION - WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND HOW TO USE?
===========================================================================

There are several components to the CSES documentation. We detail each in
turn below: 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODEBOOK OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary component  of documentation is the CSES Codebook. The 
codebook consists of six components, namely: 

1) PART 1: INTRODUCTION 
   (file name: cses4_codebook_part1_introduction.txt)
   Part 1 (This file) overview of the CSES study and data, information about 
   how to use the files, election study descriptions, information on the
   CSES datafile, the checks the CSES Secretariat conducts on the datafile
   and information on the national collaborators of the CSES project for
   each polity.  

2) PART 2: CSES VARIABLES DESCRIPTION
   (file name: cses4_codebook_part2_variables.txt)
   Part 2 is the variable description file and includes the survey 
   questions, code frames, general notes, election study notes, and 
   details about sources for macro data. 

3) PART 3: PARTIES AND LEADERS BY COUNTRY 
   (file name: cses4_codebook_part3_parties_and_leaders.txt)
   Part 3 details the party/coalition and leader numeric and alphabetical
   coding for each polity included in the CSES Module 4 dataset. 

4) PART 4: PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICTS RESPONDENTS BY POLITY
   (file name: cses4_codebook_part4_primary_electoral_districts.txt)
   Part 4 details the primary electoral district by polity for each 
   respondent included in the CSES Module 4 dataset. 

5) PART 5: ELECTION SUMMARIES BY POLITY
   (file name: cses4_codebook_part5_election_summaries.txt)
   Part 5 contains short summaries of each election included in CSES Module 
   4. It also provides analysts with details of additional sources they may 
   wish to consult to understand the elections included in CSES in greater
   detail. 

6) PART 6: STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS OVERVIEW BY POLITY
   (file name: cses4_codebook_part6.txt)
   Part 6 contains overviews of the design of each election study included 
   in CSES Module 4. It also provides analysts with details regarding the 
   polity weights provided by each election study. 

The CSES Module 4 questionnaire is also available from the website or
by referencing the corresponding variables in this codebook.

For all election studies included in CSES, collaborators have provided 
documentation to accompany their election studies. These documents, 
where available, can be found on the CSES Module 4 download page 
under "Data Center" on the CSES website (www.cses.org).

Analysts will also want to become familiar with the CSES Module 4 errata
page. It is accessible from the CSES Module 4 download page under "Data
Center" on the CSES website. Information, updates, and error notifications
and corrections are posted there, in real time, as they become available.
Please regularly check for errata notifications to keep up to date.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES project uses American English language and date standards 
(MM-DD-YYYY). In the CSES Module 4 dataset, all variables begin with the 
letter "D" (D being the fourth letter of the English alphabet and thus 
signifying Module 4). This convention helps reduce the possibility of 
overwriting data when merging with other CSES datasets.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

1) D1001-D1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables

2) D2001-D2999 Demographic variables

3) D3001-D3999 Micro-level (survey) data (the CSES Module 4 questionnaire)

4) D4001-D4999 District-level data

5) D5001-D5999 Macro-level data

In the Variable Descriptions portion of the codebook, the headers for
individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes. Variable
names do not exceed eight characters in length.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> VARIABLES NOTES

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polity's for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLES NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLES NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES codebook. 

<<>> ELECTION STUDY NOTES

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of ELECTION STUDY NOTES. 
They are notes which are attached to each variable included in the dataset
and refer to case-specific information regarding a particular variable. 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. They are also used to provide source data information for 
users. Where applicable, ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed below a particular
variable and any VARIABLES NOTES in part 2 and 3 of the CSES codebook. They
can be navigated in the codebook by searching for "ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in
Parts 2-4 of the CSES codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRE FOR MODULE 4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES Module 4 original questionnaire is available from the CSES Module 
4 study page at: 
         http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module4/module4.htm

or by referencing the corresponding variable descriptions in the CSES
Module 4 Codebook (see Part 2).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES - ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All election studies included in CSES provide numerous source material. 
These documents include the following: 
      - Macro reports 
      - Design reports 
      - Original questionnaires including the language of origin 
We describe each in turn below. 

<<>> MACRO REPORT

Collaborators submit a macro report to the CSES Secretariat when depositing
their national data. Its purpose is to provide a coherent link between 
national level specialists and data specific to the election and polity 
in question. It provides information on the election, the composition of 
cabinet before and after election, expert assessments of the parties, 
information on electoral rules operating in the polity, as well as original
sources for the country level data. It aids the CSES Secretariat in 
collating some of the macro level data for each polity included in the 
country. Where available, macro reports can be found on the CSES Module 4 
download page under "CSES Module 4 Election Study Archive" at:
http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module4/module4.htm

<<>> DESIGN REPORT

Collaborators also submit a design report to the CSES Secretariat when 
depositing their national data. It provides all information on the 
implementation of each individual election study including details
regarding fieldwork dates, mode of interview, sampling procedures, 
sampling frame, response and refusal rates, information on translation
procedures, and weights. Some of this data is included directly in the
CSES data in variables D1001-D1034. Where available, design reports can 
be found on the CSES Module 4 download page under "CSES Module 4 Election
Study Archive" at: http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module4/module4.htm
Further, Part 6 of the Codebook provides overviews of each polity's study
design and polity level weights. It draws heavily on information from
each polity's design report. 

<<>> ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRES

Where available, CSES provides the original language questionnaires from 
each polity's national election study. Further, CSES requests that all 
studies included provide the English language questionnaire used as the 
basis for translation of the CSES questionnaire into a polity's native
tongue(s). Where available, the questionnaires can be found on the CSES 
Module 4 download page under "CSES Module 4 Election Study Archive" at:
http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module4/module4.htm

===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several identification variables in CSES Module 4 which allow
users to not only identify an individual respondent, but election studies, 
and polities. 

<<>> ELECTION STUDY IDENTIFIERS

Each Election Study in CSES Module 4 is uniquely identified by two 
variables, namely: 

   - variable D1003 ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (NUMERIC POLITY)
     This variable is an eight-digit numerical code constructed from two
     components: the CSES polity code (variable D1006) and the 
     year in which the election took place (D1008). The first three digits
     represent the country codes assigned by the United Nations Statistics
     Division. The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple election
     studies within a single country for the same election. The final 
     four digits represent the year of the election. 
     E.g., 03602013. AUSTRALIA (2013)

   - variable D1004 ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (ALPHABETIC POLITY)
     This variable is an alphanumerical code constructed from two
     components: the alpha-3 country codes assigned by the United Nations
     Statistics Divisions. The remaining characters correspond 
     to the year of the election. 
     E.g., USA_2012 

<<>> POLITY IDENTIFIERS

Each Polity in CSES Module 4 is uniquely identified by two 
variables, namely: 

   - variable D1006_UN ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN CODE
     This variable consists of the numeric country codes assigned by the 
     United Nations Statistics Division to polities
     E.g., 372. IRELAND (2011)

   - variable D1006_NAM ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
     This variable consists of polity names based on those used by the
     United Nations Statistics Division. 
     E.g., New Zealand 

These polity identifiers allow for easy data bridging with other macro
data sources such as the World Bank. 

<<>> RESPONDENT IDENTIFIER

Respondents can be uniquely identified in the dataset by variable D1005. It
is an 18-character identifier. The first three characters are the numeric
version of the country codes assigned by the United Nations Statistics
Division. If applicable, the fourth character distinguishes between 
multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same election. 
If only one study is in place for the election, this digit is 0. The fifth
through eighth characters correspond to the election year (see variable
D1008). The last ten characters are the respondent identifier from D1009,
which is unique within each election study.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MISSING DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple response categories can relate to missing data relating from 
not applicable to a respondent refusing to answer or failing to answer 
a question. Users should consult individual variables for the specific
missing designations assigned to each variable. 

For some election studies in which we could not distinguish among various
answers, the code "missing" may include cases where respondents refused 
to answer the question, "don't know" responses, and cases where there
a particular question went unanswered for other reasons.
Moreover, while CSES guidelines request that the response categories 
"Refused" and "Don't Know" be volunteered responses, this was not always 
consistently applied. For instance, sometimes the options were offered 
explicitly to respondents in mail-back surveys, which do not have the 
benefit of an interviewer being present. To identify whether the response 
options were volunteered (or not) in a particular election study, users 
should refer to the original questionnaires of each country. These are
available on the Module 4 page. 

While there is no consistent CSES convention regarding the application of
missing values, some commonalities exist, namely: 
- Not applicable values are commonly designated as 7, 97, 997, 9997 etc...
- Don't know values are commonly designated as 8, 98, 998, 9998 etc... 
- Missing values are commonly designated as 9, 99, 999, 9999 etc...

However, users are advised that the commonalities do not always hold
and they are advised to consult individual variables for the specific
missing designations assigned to the variable in question. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> WEIGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES provides a number of weight measures in the CSES data (see variables 
D1010-D1014 inclusive). There is a strong degree of variance in the sample 
designs used in the national election studies included in CSES. Hence, the
weights provided by collaborators vary significantly. Users are advised
to read carefully about the different weights in CSES to ascertain
whether their analyses should be subjected to weighting and if so which
kind. 

CSES provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable D1010_) namely:

  - SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable D1010_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable D1010_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable D1010_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

For more information on polity weights, users are advised to consult Part 6
of the CSES Codebook or the individual design reports of each study. 

The remainder of the weight variables in the dataset are derivative
variables, constructed from the original weights. They are: 
 
  - FACTOR WEIGHTS (variable D1011)
    These variables report the mean weight of each type, within each 
    polity. The resulting factors are then used to create the derivative 
    Polity Weights (D1012 explained below) 

  - POLITY WEIGHTS (variable D1012)
    These variables report standardized versions (with a mean 1 within the 
    polity) of the original weights provided with the component election 
    studies, described in D1010. They are the ratio of each weighting 
    factor to the mean weight (D1011) of each type, calculated within each
    polity.

  - SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT WEIGHT (variable D1013)
    This variable reports the ratio of the average sample size to each 
    election study sample. The resulting factor is then used to create the
    derivative Dataset Weights (D1014 explained below).

  - DATASET WEIGHTS (variable D1014)
    These variables are intended for micro-level analyses involving the 
    entire CSES sample. Using the sample size adjustment (D1013), the 
    centered weights (D1012) are corrected such that each election study
    component contributes equally to the analysis, regardless of the 
    original sample size. 

Details of the calculation of the above derivative weights, including 
the precise STATA code used to create the weights, can be found in the 
variable notes for variables D1011, D1012, D1013, and D1014.     

Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
that their analyses are weighted appropriately (if applicable).The CSES 
project does not provide advice as to which weights are appropriate to 
use in particular circumstances. This is best left to analysts to decide 
based on their detailed knowledge of the research question under 
investigation. We advise analysts to consult variable notes D1010-D1014 
for more specific information on each polities weight and the derivative 
weights calculated for the Cross-National Dataset.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> FREEDOM STATUS OF ELECTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of studies that comprise CSES are collected in countries that
have free or partly free elections. However, sometimes a collaborator will
include the CSES module in a study of a polity that is a developing
democracy or that is considered not free. If the data collection is judged
to be of sufficiently high quality, the study is included in CSES datasets
even if the country is considered to be not free. The decision regarding
inclusion of particular polities in an analysis is thus left to users. 

To assist users in making appropriate decisions concerning their 
analysis, CSES Module 4 includes two measures about the freedom 
and liberty of a polity in the year the election was held (and indeed
the two preceding years), namely: 

   - FREEDOM HOUSE RATING (variables D5050)
     Freedom House assigns a numerical rating of a polity on a scale of 
     1 to 7 providing an indication of freedom. 

   - POLITY IV DEMOCRACY-AUTOCRACY RATING (variables D5051)
     Polity IV assigns a numerical rating to a polity on a scale of -10 
     to 10 indicating whether the country is strongly
     democratic or strongly autocratic. 

Freedom House and Polity IV are not affiliated with the CSES project.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and 
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding 
schemes. The details of each party/leader classification is available in 
Part 3 of the CSES Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING 

All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. These codes are used to Identify the following: 
   - who a respondent's voted for in the current election (variable D3006). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (variable D3008).
   - the respondent's party identification (variable D3018).
   - the extent of institutional contact the respondent received from a 
     party/coalition during the election campaign (variable D3021).

The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely:  
   - which party/coalition held the presidency before and after the 
     elections (variable D5007 and D5011). 
   - which party/coalition held the prime ministership before and after 
     the elections (variable D5008 and D5012). 

Where possible, the numeric codes assigned to parties/coalitions are 
consistent for the current and previous election. However, for the previous
election (variable D3008) different codes might have been allocated for the
same parties (for example a party in the current election might be standing
as party of a coalition but previously stood alone). Users are advised to
consult the election study notes for variable D3008 for each country where
details of deviations are noted. 

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition 
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most votes
etc...         

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable D3011). 
   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable D3013).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
   - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral 
     district (variable D4003). 
   - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
     (variables D5001, D5002, & D5005).
   - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
     (variables D5003 & D5004).
   - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios 
     before and after the election (variable D5009 & D5013).
   - expert judgements by the national collaborators of the 
     said party/coalition's ideological family (variable D5016).
   - expert judgements by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable D5017).

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e.: Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B etc...)

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 
   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable D3012). 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> PROCESSING CHECKS OF MODULE 4 DATASET BY THE CSES SECRETARIAT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides processing Module 4 studies from individual polities to ensure they
are fit for comparative analysis, which involves detailed checking of 
individual studies, a key role of the CSES Secretariat is to perform
several checks on the Module 4 Dataset before it is released. These checks
include (but are not confined to): 

   - CHECK OF DUPLICATE IDs
     Identification of respondents with corresponding answers to all 
     questions or respondent identification data that are similar 

   - INCONSISTENCY CHECKS
     To identify sets of variables which are inconsistent, or could be 
     perceived as inconsistent (e.g., strange skip pattern, incompatible
     answers to related questions). The CSES convention is not to change 
     data that we receive from national collaborators. Instead, 
     inconsistencies are noted in the CSES codebook under the appropriate
     variable and the data are left unchanged. This allows users to make
     the final determination on whether inconsistencies may affect their
     analyses.  

   - IRREGULAR AND EXTRAORDINARY CODE CHECKS 
     To identify irregular and extraordinary codes in the CSES Module 4 
     Dataset. Sometimes these irregular or extraordinary codes are 
     legitimate in the sense that they may be accounted for by a polity
     deviation on a particular variable.

   - THEORETICAL CHECKS  
     These checks explore expected relationships between variables that 
     we might expect to occur (e.g., correlation between Political Efficacy
     and Satisfaction with Democracy). We do this by exploring 
     distributions, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. 

   - VARIABLE AND VALUE LABEL CHECKS
     Checking all variables in the CSES Module 4 Dataset to ensure they
     are appropriately assigned labels and documented in the CSES Codebook. 

If you identify any potential issue with the CSES Module 4 data, 
please contact the CSES Secretariat by e-mail at: cses@umich.edu
