    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 1 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus, 
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Advance Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 1, go to the 
Data Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the gray box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone CSES Module documentation including Standalone CSES  
Module Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports and Election Summaries.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 2: VARIABLES DESCRIPTION"
===========================================================================

Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook provides users with information about the 
variables in the CSES IMD dataset as well as accompanying information about
each polity's election study.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES IMD CODEBOOK
===========================================================================
 
CSES IMD Codebook is produced in .txt format to allow for easy accessibility 
and as such the Codebook can be read into a variety of programs. 
 
The CSES IMD Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:
 
))) = Section Header 
 
>>> = Sub-section Header 1
 
<<>> = Sub-section Header 2
 
+++ = Tables
 
VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables 
 
POLITY NOTES = Notes for particular polity 
 
ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  
 
[ELECTION STUDY NOTES] = Notes for a particular election study where data
                         in CSES IMD deviates from published data in CSES
                         Standalone Modules.

))) CSES CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES, POLITY NOTES & ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> VARIABLE NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polity's for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. 
Where applicable, POLITY NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed 
below a particular variable and any VARIABLE NOTES in Part 2 and 3
of the CSES IMD codebook. They can be navigated in the Codebook by 
searching for "POLITY NOTES" or ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-3 
of the CSES IMD Codebook.

>>> CSES CODING OF PARTY/COALITIONS AND LEADERS IN CSES IMD - A NEW 
    DEPARTURE
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding of 
parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, 
where applicable, participating in the election or the previous election 
receive a NUMERICAL code. These codes are used to identify the following: 

   - who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - the respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consists of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999 with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower 
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name change. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalition A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the 
party/coalition that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007).
   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012).

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000 provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 3 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 3 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY CODES BY CSES MODULE"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING - RELATIONAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In CSES
IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with leaders where data is available receiving an 
alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tends to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1003
         |
         | This eight digit variable uniquely identifies an election study
         | within CSES IMD.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, variable IMD1006
         | (CSES polity code) and IMD1008_YEAR (election year).
         |
         | The first three digits are the numerical version of the polity
         | codes created by the United Nations Statistics Division
         | ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations", revised February
         | 13, 2002), except for Taiwan (see Election Study Note).
         |
         | The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single polity, for the same election.
         |
         | The fifth through eighth digits correspond to the election year
         | as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1003          
         | MODULE 2: B1003   
         | MODULE 3: C1003 
         | MODULE 4: D1003 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (ALL STUDIES): IMD1003

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1004
         |
         | This eight-character variable uniquely identifies an election
         | study within the CSES IMD.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, alphabetic 
         | country codes (ISO 3166, 'alpha-3') and IMD1008_YEAR 
         | (election year).
         |
         | The first three characters are the alphabetic country codes
         | 'alpha-3' created by the International Organization for 
         | Standardization in their ISO 3166 Standard and shared by the
         | United Nations Statistics Division ("Countries or areas, codes
         | and abbreviations", revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as an underscore (_).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1005
         |
         | This eighteen-character variable uniquely identifies a
         | respondent within the CSES IMD.
         | It equals the original respondent IDs from the Standalone CSES
         | Modules (A1005, B1005, C1005, D1005). Therefore, users who want 
         | to merge additional CSES variables not covered by the present
         | data set may do so by using this variable as the basis for
         | merging.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from three components: variable
         | IMD1006 (CSES polity code), IMD1008_YEAR (election year), and 
         | IMD1008_RES (respondent within election study).
         |
         | The first three characters are the numeric version of the
         | country codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as a zero (0).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |
         | The last ten characters are the respondent identifier from
         | IMD1008_RES, which is unique within each election study.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1005

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1006
         |
         | This four-character variable uniquely identifies a polity
         | conducting an election study that is present in the CSES
         | IMD.
         |
         | The first three characters are the numerical version of
         | the polity codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | The fourth character distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single polity, for the same election.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1006          
         | MODULE 2: B1006   
         | MODULE 3: C1006 
         | MODULE 4: D1006 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2012): IMD1006
         |
         | The 2012 American Election Study consisted of two sample 
         | components. The fourth digit in the Standalone CSES MODULE 4
         | was used to indicate the 2 components. Hence, IMD1006 differs
         | from all other election studies from the United States which
         | are included in the CSES IMD.

         In some cases, analysts may wish to consider regions of countries
         or other sample components units of analysis, rather than the
         countries themselves. We use this variable to capture information
         about subsets of respondents that are meaningful but that are not
         captured by other variables. This may, for instance, refer to
         different sample components or respondents from different panel
         components. For all other cases, this variable is coded 001.

         | Germany used two different samples, dividing the German
         | population along the former division of the country after 
         | the Second World War. The population of the two components
         | equal the population of residence in C2027 (Codebook Part 2,

         | The Campaign Wave (6 = postal campaign): A pre-election survey
         | was conducted over the course of the campaign to track short-
         | term changes in voting behavior. The rolling cross-section was
         | conducted 5 September through 11 October, during which time
         | approximately 120 computer-assisted telephone interviews per
         | day were conducted with randomly selected New Zealanders of
         | voting age. Respondents' names and addresses were also requested
         | and those who supplied them were sent a postal questionnaire
         | after the election.
         |
         | The post-election wave of the campaign sample was added to the

         | New Zealanders of Maori descent can choose to be registered on
         | a separate Maori roll, and cast their electorate votes within
         | seven constituencies that overlie the general electorates.
         | For its new sample the 2008 New Zealand Election Study sampled
         | within four subsets of registered voters and over-sampled
         | subsets 1, 3, and 4 below, groups of particular interest to the
         | researchers. For the CSES release, respondents from the three
         | over-sampled subsets were re-sampled to bring their numbers into

         | The survey was part of a rolling cross-sectional study (Wave 1:
         | 2010-2014; Wave 2: 2014-2018). In addition, respondents could
         | complete either a long or a short version of the questionnaire. 
         | The latter excluded the demographic MODULE 4 variables D2021, 
         | D2022, D2023, D2025 and D2027. To allow distinguishing between 
         | these groups, the sample component not only reflects the two

         | respondents in the sample were first-time voters who were not 
         | part of either panel. These respondents are coded as

         | IMD1008_MOD_ are binary variables indicating the CSES Module
         | which was included in the respective election study. For 
         | example, respondents from an election study with questions from
         | MODULE 3 would be coded 1 for IMD1008_MOD_3, and 0 for all other
         | IMD1008_MOD_ variables.
         |
         | The Standalone CSES Modules were administered during the
         | following years (inclusive):
         |
         | CSES MODULE 1: 1996 - 2002
         | CSES MODULE 2: 2001 - 2006

         | CSES MODULE 4: 2011 - 2016
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 2 is from 1996 to 2001. 
         | However, the Portuguese election study of 2002 included both
         | CSES MODULES 1 and 2 in their study. For more see ELECTION STUDY
         | NOTE for Portugal below. 
         |         
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 3 is from 2006 to 2011. 
         | The questionnaire was finalized for data collection beginning 
         | in 2006, however there are three pilot studies from 2005 
         | covering MODULE 3, namely Germany (2005), Norway (2005) and 
         | Poland (2005).
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 4 is from 2011 to 2016.
         | A preliminary questionnaire was used for pretests in 2011 -
         | this version of the questionnaire was very similar to the final
         | version. The questionnaire was finalized in 2012.
         |
         | These variables are original to CSES IMD and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | covered both the MODULE 1 and the MODULE 2 questionnaire. 
         | Respondents from the 2002 Portuguese study are thus coded

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1010_
         |
         | These variables contain the election study weights of the 
         | standalone CSES Modules, originally provided as variables 
         | A1012_, B1012_, C1012_, and D1012_. 
         |
         | They are derivative weights which have been calculated so that
         | for each weight (sample, demographic, political), each 
         | respondent within each election study has a mean weight of "1". 
         | If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of survey interviews in 
         | the election study. 
         |
         | The STATA code used to create the variables can be found in the
         | the original documentation of the weighting variables which is
         | available in Part 2 of the codebook for each of the standalone 
         | CSES modules. 
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them. For IMD1010_, users are advised to pay
         | special attention to the documentation of the original weights
         | provided by collaborators (A1010_, B1010_, C1010_, D1010_) and 
         | the factor variables reporting the mean weight of each type
         | (A1011_, B1011_, C1011_, D1011_), available in Part 2 of the
         | codebook for each of the standalone CSES modules.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. 
         |
         | In the table below, we give an overview about what types of 
         | weights were originally provided by collaborators. More 
         | information on these weights is available in the Codebook Parts 2
         | of the CSES MODULES and in the design reports provided by 
         | collaborators.
         |
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables. Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is unavailable, these
         | variables are coded 1.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-WALLON (1999): IMD1010_3
         |
         | For 447 respondents, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – LITHUANIA (1997): IMD1010_2
         | 
         | The 1997 Lithuanian study was meant to be representative of
         | the population from ages 15 to 74. Hence, the study includes 
         | 49 respondents who were younger than 18 and ineligible to vote
         | at the time of the election. The originally deposited 
         | demographic weight was calculated based on the full sample, 
         | including those respondents who were ineligible to vote.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998): IMD1010_2, IMD1010_3
         |
         | For 287 respondents, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2011): IMD1010_3
         | 
         | Because of compulsory voting in Peru, non-voters are coded as
         | zero in IMD1010_3 and are thus excluded from any analysis, 
         | when the weight is applied.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2016): IMD1010_1-IMD1010_3
         |
         | Political weights were not constructed for 123 respondents in 
         | CSES Module 4. 105 of these respondents did not cast a vote in 
         | the presidential elections (IMD3001_PR_1) and the remaining 18
         | respondents did not specify their vote choice in 
         | the presidential elections (IMD3002_PR_1). These cases were 
         | set to zero for the political weight variable and thus, are
         | dropped from analyses if IMD1010_3 is applied.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2005): IMD1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight was constructed on the basis of Census
         | 2001 information about distribution of 18+ years of age
         | residents in Continental Portugal on the basis of sex (2
         | strata), age (3 strata), and education (3 strata).
         |
         | The demographic weight was originally deposited with 215 cases
         | having missing data. In the CSES data file, these cases are
         | coded "0."  These are cases for which at least one relevant
         | demographic variable was missing for the respondent. The
         | collaborator preferred to assign a weight of "0" to these cases
         | given that the demographic information was not complete for the
         | case.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SPAIN (2000): IMD1010_2
         |
         | For one respondent, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | IMD1014_2 was only calculated for respondents for whom the

         | Following CSES conventions, the scale for IMD2003 is 
         | based on the highest educational attainment, rather than on 
         | enrollment in an educational program. For example, only 
         | respondents who have obtained a university degree would be 
         | coded as "04. UNIVERSITY EDUCATION". 
         | 
         | As there was no single unique coding classification for education
         | across CSES Modules, harmonization is based on re-coding 
         | education variables from previous CSES Modules according to the

         | In CSES Module 4, the ISCED scheme was introduced to measure
         | educational attainment which included two categories for 
         | secondary education, lower and upper. Respondents coded as 
         | "03. ISCED LEVEL 2 - LOWER SECONDARY" were coded into CSES IMD
         | code "02. PRIMARY EDUCATION/LOWER SECONDARY EDUCATION" to ensure
         | consistency with other CSES Modules in which the category 
         | "SECONDARY COMPLETED" referred to respondents who had attained
         | the minimum level of qualifications normally required for entry
         | into university of other degree level higher education. 
         | According to the ISCED coding scheme, only the completion of
         | an upper secondary educational program would allow for someone
         | to enter a degree program. Hence, the two secondary education
         | from CSES Module 4 were split.

         | As there was no single unique coding classification for 
         | religious denomination across CSES Modules, harmonization is
         | based on re-coding religious denomination variables from

         | presented above. 
         |
         | In what follows, we list how the original categories employed in
         | the Standalone CSES Modules were re-coded for the CSES IMD.

         | Income ranges shown represent sample quintiles (not population 
         | quintiles).
         |
         | Where data were deposited in this format, income ranges shown 
         | are as originally reported by collaborators including gaps 
         | between contiguous sets of ranges.
         |
         | Where deposited income data were not grouped into sample 
         | quintiles, the data have been re-coded into quintiles, according
         | to sample proportions (not national statistics). For cases where
         | it was not possible to compute sample quintiles, the income 
         | categories approximating sample quintiles the closest have been
         | used. Consequently, this variable may contain distributions that
         | do not really represent quintiles.
         |
         | In some polities, annual income data is collected from 
         | while in others, monthly income data is collected. Users are 
         | advised to consult the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for 
         | more precise information.

         | The income variable results from the combination of variables 
         | SE12 and SE12A.
         |
         | SE12 is the direct answer to the question, "What is your
         | family's monthly income?" To those who did not answer we asked,
         | "Is your family's monthly income between these categories?";
         | this is SE12A. V99 results from the combination of both
         | questions grouped in quintiles.

IMD3001       >>> TURNOUT - MAIN ELECTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The wording of this item, which is to record voting in the
         national election, follows national standards.

         This item ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a ballot
         in the main election, regardless of whether or not it was valid.
         In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         election only, then this variable reports the turnout decision for
         that particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         place, e.g., a presidential and a lower house election, this
         variable reports the turnout decision in the main election. 
         See variable notes for more information.

         | Even though the 1996 presidential elections in Romania were the 
         | main election, the lower house turnout variable is coded here. 
         | The reason is that the presidential turnout variable which 
         | was originally deposited refers to the second rather than the
         | first round of the 1996 presidential elections.

         This item ascertains whether or not the respondent
         cast a ballot, regardless of whether or not it was valid.

         If the data collection occurs between rounds in a two round
         election, this item should ascertain whether or not the respondent

         | Separate micro-level turnout variables referring to a distinct
         | type of election (presidential, lower house, upper house) were 
         | only introduced in CSES MODULE 4. Before, turnout was captured 
         | by one (A2028) or two (B3004_, C3021_) general variables. In 
         | these cases, information about the type of election the turnout
         | variable referred to were provided in the election study notes.
         |
         | For the CSES INTEGRATED MODULE DATASET, micro-level turnout 
         | variables were harmonized according to the standard established
         | in MODULE 4. 
         | 
         | Inconsistency response categories from CSES Module 
         | 1 coded as "6. INCONSISTENT RESPONSE: VOTED; NO VOTE CHOICE 
         | INDICATED" and "7. INCONSISTENT RESPONSE: DID NOT VOTE; VOTE 
         | CHOICE INDICATED" were included in IMD as "1. RESPONDENT CAST A 
         | BALLOT" and "0. RESPONDENT DID NOT CAST A BALLOT." The 
         | inconsistency response category "4. INCONSISTENT RESPONSE: R
         | reported not casting a ballot but reported a vote choice" was 
         | coded as "0. RESPONDENT DID NOT CAST A BALLOT" in IMD.
         |
         | Inconsistency response category from CSES Module 2 coded as  
         | "4. INCONSISTENT RESPONSE: R reported not casting a ballot but
         | reported a vote choice" was coded as "0. RESPONDENT DID NOT
         | CAST A BALLOT" in IMD.

IMD3002_OUTGOV  >>> CURRENT MAIN ELECTION: VOTE CHOICE - OUTGOING 
                    GOVERNMENT (INCUMBENT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This item ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a ballot 
         for the outgoing incumbent, regardless of whether or not it was 
         valid. 
         In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         election only, this variable reports the voting decision for
         that particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         place, e.g., a presidential and a lower house election, this
         variable reports the voting decision in the main election. These
         are listed in the table below. 
         
         In case of a presidential election, the variable refers to the 
         incumbent president and/or the incumbent president's party. In all
         other cases, the variable refers to the party/parties which 
         was/were part of the outgoing cabinet. 

         In mixed electoral systems where voters have a list vote and a 
         district candidate vote, the list vote was used to determine if 
         the respondent voted for the outgoing government or not.

         In case of a caretaker government, the party affiliation of its 
         members was used to code this variable. Cabinet members without
         a formal party affiliation were not considered for this variable.

         For election studies included in CSES Modules 1 and 2, the coding
         was based on a variety of sources. For CSES Module 3 and 4, the 
         information in the macro variables about the party of the 
         incumbent president and the cabinet membership was used. 

         This variable is original to CSES IMD and therefore there are no
         corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | POLITY NOTES – HONG KONG: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The Chief Executive (CE) in Hong Kong is the highest government 
         | official but they do not belong to any political party. Hence, 
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as “9999996. CANNOT DECIPHER/INCUMBENT 
         | DID NOT CONTEST.”

         | POLITY NOTES – SWITZERLAND: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The Federal Council of Switzerland functions as the collective 
         | executive in Switzerland. Because the Federal President rotates
         | among its members from each of the parties on a fixed, annual 
         | basis, no incumbent was coded. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD3002_OUTGOV

         | The incumbent president at the time of the election, Alexander 
         | Lukashenko, was not a member officially of any party. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (1999): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president at that time, Tagle, was a member of the 
         | Christian Democratic Party. He was elected in 1993 with the 
         | support of the alliance, Concertation, which the Christian 
         | Democracy Party was a member of. In the 1999 election, however, 
         | the Concertation alliance supported Ricardo Lagos from the Party 
         | for Democracy. Because the numerical party codes in CSES Module 
         | 1 referred to the individual parties and not the alliance, 
         | respondents were coded as “9999996. CANNOT DECIPHER/INCUMBENT 
         | DID NOT CONTEST.” 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2009): IMD3002_OUTGOV

         | The incumbent president, Michelle Bachelet (Socialist Party),

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | Prior to the election, the Czech Republic was governed by a 
         | caretaker government led by Jiri Rusnok. 14 of the 15 cabinet
         | members had no formal party membership. Thus, only respondents 
         | who voted for the Christian Democratic Union - Czech People's
         | Party (KDU-CSL), the party of the 15th cabinet member, were 
         | coded as "1. VOTED FOR THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT" here. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2012): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The government at the time of the election was a caretaker 
         | government (May 6, 2012 to June 17, 2012). All of its members 
         | were independents. Hence, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as “9999996.
         | CANNOT DECIPHER/INCUMBENT DID NOT CONTEST.”

         | POLITY NOTES – HONG KONG: IMD3002_OUTGOV

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | Because the 2013 Japanese election study in Module 4 referred to

         |
         | The incumbent Mwai Kibaki (Party of National Unity, PNU) did not 
         | contest in the 2013 presidential elections because of term 
         | limitations which permitted him to run for a third term. Also
         | the PNU did not field a candidate of its own in 2013.
       
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – KYRGYZSTAN (2005): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The presidential office was held by the interim Kurmanbek
         | Bakiev who had taken over the office three and a half months
         | prior to the election after then-President Akayev fled the 
         | country because of protests. Hence, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as 
         | “9999996. CANNOT DECIPHER/INCUMBENT DID NOT CONTEST.”

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – LITHUANIA (1997): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent president Algirdas Brazauskas (Democratic Labour
         | Party of Lithuania, LDDP) did not contest for another term and
         | his party, the LDDP, did not field or support another candidate.

         |

         | candidacy. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – PERU (2016): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – ROMANIA (1996): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The lower house election was chosen as the main election for 
         | 1996 because the data for the presidential election in Module 1
         | refers to the second round. Hence, the incumbent party here was
         | the party of the then Prime Minister, Nicolae Vacaroiu (Romanian
         | Party of Social Democracy, PSD which was known then as the Party
         | of Social Democracy in Romania, PDSR).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – ROMANIA (2014): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | While the incumbent President Basescu technically ran on a 
         | Democrat Liberal Party (PDL) ticket in 2009, Romania presidents 
         | cannot be legally member of a party. According to the macro 
         | report from Module 4, Basescu was also closer to the People’s 
         | Movement Party (PMP) during the second half of his term. Hence, 
         | respondents were coded as “9999996. CANNOT DECIPHER/INCUMBENT 
         | DID NOT CONTEST.”

         | the previous Russian presidential elections in 2000 and the
         | the 2004 election. Hence, he was identified as the 
         | incumbent president.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES – THAILAND (2007): IMD3002_OUTGOV

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3005_3
         |
         | Respondents' party mentions in IMD3005_3 depend on the two 
         | former questions (IMD3005_1 and IMD3005_2). The party mention in 
         | IMD3005_3 should have only been asked for those respondents that
         | reported to be close (IMD3005_1) or at least closer (IMD3005_2) 
         | to a party.
         | However, there are several respondents that mentioned a party
         | (IMD3005_3), without feeling close (IMD3005_1) or closer 
         | (IMD3005_2) to a party. These data remained unchanged. For
         | further details on these inconsistencies, see Standalone CSES
         | Module Codebooks. 
         |
         | For respondents who volunteered to name more than one party
         | to identify with in MODULE 1 or MODULE 2 (SQ3a, Q18A), there was
         | a follow-up question, asking respondents to specify a single
         | party they felt closest to (SQ3b, Q18B).
         | Furthermore, MODULES 1 and 2 differentiated between respondents
         | from settings where party blocks (or electoral alliances) formed
         | for the respective election and settings in which this was not
         | the case. Respondents initially indicating to identify with a
         | party block or an electoral alliance (SQ3a, Q18A) received a
         | special follow-up question, prompting respondents to specify
         | which affiliated party they identify with most (LQ3a(1), Q18A1).
         | For the CSES IMD, in case a respondent provided only one answer 
         | to A3005_/B3029_, this answer was adopted for IMD3005_3,
         | irrespective of whether respondents named a single party or an
         | electoral alliance. In cases respondents initially provided
         | multiple parties that they feel close to, as indicated by 
         | A3006/B3030, Q3b/Q18B was used for IMD3005_3. 
         | Finally, Q13d/Q18D was used if respondents replied NO to 
         | IMD3005_1 (Are you close to any political party) but replied 
         | YES to IMD3005_2 (Do you feel closer to one party).

         | answered of respondents if they reported to feel closer to one

         | election studies, respondents who are coded as "9. MISSING" for
         | variable A3010 are also coded as "9" for variable A3010,

         | depending on whether party blocks (or electoral alliances) 
         | formed for the respective election or not.
         | The LONG version of Q3/Q18 was used for respondents in systems
         | where AT LEAST ONE party block (or electoral alliance) was
         | formed. This version of the party identification question

         | MODULES 3 and 4:
         | "Where would you place yourself on this scale?"
         |         
         | In MODULE 1, respondents were first asked to place themselves 
         | on the left-right scale before placing parties on the same scale.
         | That question order was reversed for MODULES 2 to 4.

         | scale questions even if left-right is not considered to be
         | meaningful/important/widely understood in the area being
         | studied. However, it was possible to add an optional
         | alternative scale question on which respondents were asked to 
         | place parties A - I and themselves. These alternative scale 
         | questions were not harmonized for the IMD, but are available
         | in the separate MODULES 1 to 4.

         | in one of the appropriate variables on IMD3006 or IMD3007_, but

         | IMD3009_ asked respondents to place the Leaders of Parties A-I 
         | on a 0-10 likeability scale.
         |
         | Placement of this question in successive Standalone CSES Module 
         | questionnaire varies and thus might have resulted in a small
         | deviation in the introduction to the question - please consult 
         | the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for more information.
         | In the following, question wordings for each Module are listed. 
         |
         | MODULE 1:
         | "And now, using the same scale, I'd like to
         | ask you how much you like or dislike some political leaders.
         | Again, if I come to a leader you haven't heard of or you do not
         | know enough about them, just say so. The first political leader 
         | is LEADER A."
         |
         | MODULES 3 and 4:
         | "And what do you think of the presidential candidates/
         | party leaders? After I read the name of a presidential
         | candidate/party leader, please rate them on a scale from
         | 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly dislike that
         | candidate and 10 means that you strongly like that
         | candidate. If I come to a presidential candidate/party
         | leader you haven't heard of or you feel you do not know
         | enough about, just say so.
         | The first is [LEADER A].
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER B]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER C]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER D]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER E]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER F]?
         | Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER G]?

         |      
         | Leaders and their alphabetical classifications for each country
         | are detailed in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. For linking

         |
         | Users should note that IMD3009_ includes several observations in 
         | which all leaders are scored equally by respondents. Also, there
         | may be instances in which respondents provide the same answer to
         | all items, e.g. "don't know". These data remain unchanged.

         doesn't make any difference who is in power and FIVE means
         that it makes a big difference who is in power), where would
         you place yourself?

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3011
         |
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, IMD3011 had an inversed scale running from
         | "1. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHO IS IN POWER" to "5. IT DOESN'T 
         | MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHO IS IN POWER". These scales were re-coded 
         | to fit the coding of IMD3011 as outlined above.
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, therefore, question wording reflects the 
         | inversed scale and deviated slightly from the recent version 
         | applied for the CSES IMD.     
         |
         | In MODULE 2, some election studies used an earlier version of 
         | the CSES questionnaire which included the words "BIG" and "ANY" 
         | in the question text and response options.
         |
         | For example:
         | "1. It makes a BIG difference who is in power"
         | "5. It doesn't make ANY difference who is in power"
         |
         | As a result, there has been variation in question-wording and
         | response options for IMD3011 in MODULE 2. A table documenting
         | how election studies asked these items is available in CSES

         people vote for can make a big difference to what happens.
         Using the scale on this card, (where ONE means that voting
         won't make any difference to what happens and FIVE means that

         | perception of the state of economy (IMD3013_1) were administered
         | in different election studies. In some cases the follow-up 
         | question on a worse state of economy (IMD3013_3) was asked
         | irrespectively of a respondent's answer on IMD3013_1. 
         | Consequently, IMD3013_3 sometimes includes information on
         | respondents that did not mention a worse state of economy 
         | (code 5) in IMD3013_1. These data remained unchanged.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5000_
         |
         | In the Standalone CSES Modules, parties A through F are the six 
         | most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in descending order of
         | their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary election 
         | (unless otherwise stated). Parties G, H, and I are supplemental
         | parties. They may, but do not have to, accord with how parties
         | A-F are ordered and often reflect important or notable parties
         | within a country or members of party coalitions. 
         | For the CSES IMD, this alphabetical structure was maintained, 
         | meaning that alphabetical codes assigned to parties/coalitions
         | and leaders in Standalone CSES Modules were not changed. Rather, 
         | IMD5000_ serves as an identifier in the dataset, providing 
         | the unique and unambiguous numerical party codes listed in 
         | Codebook Part 3. As codes in IMD5000_ are labeled with the 
         | corresponding party names, they allow for easy identification of 
         | the relational data. 
         |
         | For the CSES IMD dataset, alphabetical codes are used to 
         | identify the following:
         | - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition 
         |   (variable IMD3008_). 
         | - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
         |   (variable IMD3007_).
         | - expert judgments by the national collaborators of the 
         |   said party/coalition's left-right placement (variable 
         |   IMD5012).
         | 
         | In most cases, the alphabetical party codes correspond to the
         | alphabetical code for the leader of that same party (e.g., 
         | LEADER A is the leader of PARTY A). However, there are 
         | exceptions, such as in instances in which data is available for
         | two leaders of the same party (e.g., Ireland 2011 in CSES Module
         | 4). For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions and leaders, please see Part 3 of the CSES IMD
         | Codebook.
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5006_2
         | 
         | The Voting Age Population (VAP) includes all citizens above the
         | legal voting age in a country. It is not intended to be a 
         | precise measure of the number of citizens entitled to vote as it
         | does not take into account legal or systematic impediments such 
         | as resident non-citizens. Rather, its intent is to provide an 
         | estimate of turnout besides estimates based solely on an 
         | electoral register. Voter registers are often outdated or 
         | inaccurate or in some circumstances are not used for elections
         | (e.g.: 1994 South African elections).         
         |
         | In some polities, voters are registered automatically and hence
         | it might be expected that the electoral register measure and the
         | voting age population would be identical. This is not always the
         | case for the reasons set out above. However, and unless we can
         | verify accuracy, CSES reports the voting age population as 
         | listed by the IDEA. However, ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in
         | Part 2 of the Codebooks for the respective CSES Modules, do
         | alert users to instances where voter registration is automatic 
         | and thus to cases for which in theory the ER and VAP estimates
         | could be identical.

IMD5014       >>> ELECTORAL FORMULA: PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This variable indicates what electoral formula was used to elect
         the president. The variable is coded in all cases where presidents
         are elected by the electorate. In cases where presidents are 
         elected by the national parliament, the variable is coded as 
         "not applicable." Furthermore, IMD5014 is a system variable, 
         meaning that is also coded for a country even though a 
         presidential may not have taken place (e.g., Mexico 2003).

         The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder's
         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World,
         1946-2000 (http://mattgolder.com/elections, Date accessed: May 17,
         2018).

         PLURALITY - the candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE - A candidate must win over 50% of the vote
         to win. If no  candidate wins this many votes, then there is a
         runoff between the top two candidates.
         QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE - Each qualified majority system specifies
         a particular percentage of the vote that a candidate must win in
         order to be elected in the first round. If two or more candidates
         overcome these thresholds, then the one with the highest number of
         votes wins. The qualified majority systems vary in terms of the
         electoral procedure that applies when these thresholds are not
         met.
         ELECTORAL COLLEGE - The candidate that wins a plurality of the
         electoral college votes wins.
         SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE - Requires voters to rank single
         candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes are
         transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The
         candidate that obtains this quota first is elected.

         These variables report Freedom House's rating of freedom in a
         country at three time periods: the election year (time T), one
         year before election (T-1), and two years before election (T-2).
         Each country and territory is assigned a numerical rating, on a
         scale of 1 to 7. A rating of 1 indicates the highest degree of
         freedom and 7 the least amount of freedom.
         CSES reports average of the "Political Rights" and "Civil
         Liberties" scores.

         | Until 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for
         | Political Rights and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and
         | 2.5 were designated "Free"; between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free",
         | and between 5.5 and 7.0 "Not Free". Beginning with the ratings
         | for 2003, countries whose combined average ratings fall between
         | 3.0 and 5.0 are "Partly Free", and those between 5.5 and 7.0 are
         | "Not Free".

         These variables report POLITY IV ratings of institutionalized
         democracy versus autocracy in a country, at three time periods:
         the election year (time T), one year before election (T-1), and
         two years before election (T-2).

         CSES reports the original variable POLITY - Combined Polity Score.
         The variable is constructed by subtracting the autocracy score
         from the democracy score; the resulting scale ranges from +10
         (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic).
