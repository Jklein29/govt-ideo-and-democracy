))) CSES PROJECT PROFILE
===========================================================================

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative
program of cross-national public opinion research.  A standard survey
module, CSES Module 1, was administered as part of nearly 40 national
post-election study projects.  The CSES Secretariat, with the help of
the collaborators in each participant country, has compiled these data and
supplemented them with socio-demographic information about each
respondent.  To facilitate cross-national comparative analyses, these
micro-level data have been further supplemented with district level
information that provide insight into the respondent's political
context, and macro-level data that detail the respondent's political
system, as a whole.  At each level of data collection, the measurements
used have been standardized to promote comparison.

By collaborating in this way, the CSES community hopes to forward
scientific inquiry into the relationship between electoral institutions
and political behavior.  In particular, CSES Module 1
focuses on the structure electoral institutions provide voters in their
beliefs and choices.  Further, the survey items used in Module 1 emphasize
the ways in which citizens assess and evaluate the institutions of their
governments.  For example, what impact, if any, do institutional
differences -- in electoral laws, in the nature of political parties, or
in the structure and longevity of the political regime -- have on the way
that citizens assess the performance of the electoral process, political
parties, and democracy as a whole? Do some kinds of institutional
arrangements produce more positive evaluations than others?  Does citizen
satisfaction with the performance of political parties increase with the
number and ideological diversity of the political choices that citizens
are offered?  Module 1 also considers how well the deeply-rooted divisions
in society are managed, moderated or alleviated by political institutions:
How do institutional structures affect the nature and intensity of social
and political cleavages? Do federal systems suppress social cleavages? How
well do different party systems "encapsulate conflict" by constraining
social divisions?  Do plurality systems produce more broadly based parties
that discourage the kind of sectional and ideological parties (and hence
intense political cleavages) that can more easily survive under
proportional representation? The CSES project, by explicitly linking
individual attitudes and behaviors to political context in a variety of
settings, provides analysts with the resources to address these and many
other types of questions.

>>> CSES MODULE 1 STUDY DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Module 1 materials include public opinion survey data, supplementary
demographic data, district level and macro data collected in 39 election
studies, usually in the weeks following national elections held between
1996 and 2001.

The Planning Committee oversaw every stage of the project development,
include the design of the survey instrument, demographic and macro
measures.  The various report, documents and pilot studies prepared by
members of the Planning Committee in the course of Module 1 development
are avaialable on the CSES website.

CSES relies on the collaborators in each country to ensure that the data
are collected in the most transparent and reliable way possible.  The
micro level component of the data collection exercise is documented in the
"Sample Design and Data Collection Reports" completed by each
collaborator, and available on the CSES website.  A complete list of the
collaborators and CSES contacts within each country is also available on
the CSES website.

The following election study included CSES Module 1, but did not appear in
the CSES Module 1 Full Release dataset due to an administrative oversight
on the part of CSES. Requests for the data may be addressed to the

>>> MICRO LEVEL (SURVEY) COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ten-minute CSES module was usually administered as a single
uninterrupted block of questions at the beginning or the end of a
national election survey.  There are several features of this component of
which analysts should be aware:

A.  The question text is included in the variable documentation of this
codebook.  The questions are reported in the order in which they appear in
the questionnaire.

B.  Where there are differences in the way a particular question was
administered in an election study, this is noted in the "Election Study
Notes," following the documentation of the corresponding variable.

C.  There are several sets of party and leader evaluation items included
in the module.  These correspond to parties labeled A-F, in descending
order, the six most popular parties in the lower house elections (or
presidential elections if legislative elections were not held).  Where
respondents were asked to evaluate other parties, these evaluations
have been included and are labeled parties G-I, regardless of their vote
shares (for a total of six parties per election study).  The parties and
leader to which these evaluations apply are identified in Appendix I.

D.  There are several questions (including the vote-choice and party
identification items) which ask the respondents to specify a political
party.  The codes for these items are also reported in Appendix I.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DISTRICT LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The district level variables report the official returns of the lower
house (first segment) election for each respondent's district, as
published by the official election authority in each country (Great
Britain is the sole exception: these data are from P.  Norris (2001),"The
British Parliamentary Constituency Database, 1992-2001").  Although this
is the most reliable source, the availability of district-level data is
limited by what is actually published by electoral commissions (e.g. some
did not publish turnout at the district level), and by the form in which
these data are made public (e.g. including what language, but also how the
returns are reported: some commissions report only actual votes received
by each winning candidate, and not the number of votes cast in favor of
each party).  The following district level data are included in the CSES
datafile (X's indicate availability):

                   # Seats     #Candidates/   Vote      Turnout

>>> MACRO LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To supplement the micro data, the teams of researchers responsible for
the collection of the public opinion data also compiled and deposited
electoral legislation, political party platforms, and official electoral
returns.

To facilitate this process, a detailed questionnaire was construct to
serves as a framework for the macro component of the project.  The
Macro Data Reports completed by the CSES collaborators can be found on the
CSES website.

The text of the questions is provided in the variable documentation section
of this codebook.

Additional measures, thought pertinent to the micro-district-
macro design, are also compiled and available in the CSES datafiles. A
bibliography of the sources consulted follows the main body of these
introductory materials.

Finally, to facilitate the use of the macro data, the steps taken in
the coding of several systems are provided to illustrate the working
definitions of some of the terms used in the documentation of these
variables:


A.  ELECTORAL STRUCTURES:

This section illustrates how characteristics of electoral systems are
coded in the macro level study.  Consider the case of Hungary:  Under
Hungarian electoral rules, the (unicameral) legislative house is composed
of 328 seats. Of these, 176 are elected in single-member districts and 152
are elected in 20 multi- member districts.  The Hungarian case is coded in
the following way:

A5024    NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS - LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         One (there is no 'upper' house, like the American Senate, or the
         British House of Lords).

A5025_1  NUMBER OF ELECTORAL SEGMENTS - LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         Two (as the members elected in single member districts are elected
         independently of those elected to seats in the multi-member
         districts, there are two electoral segments).  Usually the number
         of electoral segments corresponds to the number of independent
         ballots cast by voters for each legislative body.

A5026_1  NUMBER OF PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICTS - LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         176 (a primary electoral district is the smallest geographic
         area in which votes are tallied to allocate seats in a
         legislature).

A5027_1  NUMBER OF SEATS- LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         176 (within this segment there are 176 seats to be allocated).

A5028_1  DISTRICT MAGNITUDE- LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         1 ('district magnitude' refers to the average number of seats
         allocated per primary district; in systems with multi-member
         districts, this is the total number of seats divided by the
         number of districts).

A5029_1  NUMBER OF SECONDARY DISTRICTS- LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         1 (the votes cast for non-winning members in the single-member
         districts are cumulated as "remainder votes" at the national
         level for the allocation of 58 "reserved" seats).

A5030_1  NUMBER OF TERTIARY DISTRICTS- LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         0 (if, for example, the single member district "remainder votes"
         could first be applied to the allocation of regional seats, and
         then the "remainder votes" from this allocation were cumulated
         at the national level, then there would be several secondary
         districts and 1 tertiary district).


B.  LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: VOTING PROCEDURES:

In systems where there is more than one electoral segment, the voting
procedures usually vary across segments, as well as across legislative
chambers.  For this reason, the macro data file includes data for the
voting procedures for each electoral segment in each of the legislative
houses. To illustrate, consider how the voting procedures for Japan are
reported in the datafile:

A5031    COMPULSORY VOTING:
         '0.  No.' (Some countries do have laws requiring their citizens
         to vote.  However, the sanctions imposed on non-voters in these
         countries vary widely, and are reported in this variable).

A5032_1  VOTES CAST - LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         One (under some electoral laws, citizens may vote for as many
         candidates as there are seats to be contested; in Japan, however,
         the first electoral segment is composed of 300 seats contested in
         single member districts and citizens cast only one vote in this
         segment).

A5033_1  VOTING PROCEDURES - LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         '01.  Single Candidate'. (In some majoritarian electoral systems,
         e.g. Australia, in selecting a candidate, voters will also choose
         'alternatives' by ranking the political candidates.  If no
         candidate wins a majority in the first round, the candidate with
         the smallest number of first preferences is eliminated, and her
         supporters' second preferences are allocated among the remaining
         candidates.  Alternatively, as will be discussed below, in some
         systems, voters elect party lists rather than candidates.  In
         Japan, as the first segment is elected through single member
         districts voters select a single candidate).


C.  LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: HOW VOTES BECOME SEATS:

In systems where there is more than one electoral segment, the electoral
formulae used to allocate seats usually vary across segments.  For this
reason, the macro. data file includes data for the electoral formulae for
each electoral segments within each of the legislative chambers.  For
example, these characteristics of New Zealand's electoral system are
reported in the following way:

A5034_1  ELECTORAL FORMULA- LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         '11. Plurality- Single Member Districts.' (In the first electoral
         segment, New Zealanders elect 65 representatives in single-member
         districts).

A5034_2  LOWER HOUSE- SECOND SEGMENT- ELECTORAL FORMULA:
         '034. PR- Ste-Lague.' (The remaining 55 seats in the legislature
         are allocated according to the percentage of popular vote each
         party receives; systems of this sort are broadly referred to as
         "proportional representation" systems.  There are several
         different forumlae used to translate popular vote into seats; the
         Ste-Lague Highest Averages method used in New Zealand is among the
         more commonly used formulae).

A5035_1  THRESHOLD - LOWER - 1ST SEGMENT:
         '0. NA.' (Unlike in some proportional representation systems,
         candidates in New Zealand do not need to be supported by a
         specified percentage of the popular vote in order to gain their
         seats.  Rather, candidates who win a simple plurality are elected
         to the seat representing their district).

A5035_2  LOWER HOUSE- SECOND SEGMENT- THRESHOLD:
         '5.00 percent'. (In order to to be included in the allocation of
         seats via the Ste. Lague formula, parties in New Zealand must be
         supported by at least 5.00 percent of the national popular vote).


D.  TYPES OF ELECTORAL ALLIANCES

Some electoral systems allow parties to ally themselves through formal or
informal agreements.  Where this occurs, there may be restrictions or
additional requirements that party alliances are subject to.  To clarify
some of the terminology used in the codebook, this section provides some
definitions of the type of electoral alliances parties may form:

MULTI-PARTY ENDORSEMENTS:  Candidates may sometimes be endorsed by more
than one party, while maintaining their own party identification and
membership.

APPARENTEMENT:  In list PR systems, small parties may be unable to gain
seats in the legislature because their proportions of the popular
vote fall below the threshold needed to be included in the allocation
of seats.  In some systems however, parties are allowed to form 'cartels,'
such that, although participant parties stand for election as individual
parties, their vote totals are cumulated and seats are allocated to the
'cartel,' and then distributed among the participant parties.

JOINT LISTS:  In contrast to apparentement, where parties maintain their
own party lists and votes are pooled between the parties, parties may
present joint lists, in which candidates from both parties are included,
and elected according to the order prescribed by the list.  Joint lists
tend to be more formal and complete alliances than apparentement
agreements.

It is important to note that, in some systems, there are different
thresholds, etc. for joint party lists contesting an election than for
individual parties.

))) HOW TO USE THE CSES MODULE 1 DOCUMENTATION
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several components to the CSES documentation. Analysts will
want to become familiar with all of them.

For most election studies, collaborators have provided documentation
to accompany their election studies, including the source macro
reports, design reports, and original-language questionnaire(s). These 
documents, where available, can be found on the CSES website (www.cses.org)
by visiting the "Data Center" and then clicking on the CSES Module 1
download page.

The CSES Module 1 questionnaire is also available from the website or
by referencing the corresponding variables in this codebook.

The codebook consists of three files:

"cses1_codebook_part1_introduction.txt" is the codebook introduction, the
file you are reading now; it includes an overview of the study and data,
information about use of the files, general election study descriptions
and notes, and a bibliography

"cses1_codebook_part2_variables.txt" is the variable descriptions' file,
including questions, code frames, general notes, and notes specific to
an election study (by variable)

"cses1_codebook_part3_appendices.txt" contains Appendix I (Parties and
Leaders), Appendix II (Primary Electoral Districts), and Appendix III
(District-Level Candidates).

Analysts will also want to become familiar with the CSES Module 1 errata
page, which is accessible from the CSES Module 1 download page on the 
website. Updates, error notifications and corrections are posted there, 
often in real time, as they become available. Please check the errata page
regularly for new notifications.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the CSES Module 1 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "A".
This convention helps reduce the possibility of overwriting data when
merging with other CSES data sets.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

A1001-A1999 identification, weight, and election study variables
A2001-A2999 demographic and vote choice variables
A3001-A3999 micro-level data (the CSES Module 1 Questionnaire)
A4001-A4999 district-level data
A5001-A5999 macro-level data

Variable names are separated off by two lines of dashes.  Variable names
do not exceed eight characters in length.  In the variable descriptions
portion of codebook file "cm_cod2.txt", the leftmost eight columns are
intended to be for variable names only.

Most sections of the codebook can be navigated in the machine-readable
files by searching for the characters ">>>" or ")))" as appropriate.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO USE THE CSES MODULE 1 DATA FILES
===========================================================================

We recommend that PC users create the following directory on their hard
drive, and to download their files from this Module 1 release to that 
location:

  c:/cses/module1/20151215/

The subdirectory value "20151215" represents the version (release date) of 
the dataset - this being the 2015, December 15th version of CSES Module 1.

This organization method allows users with multiple CSES datasets and/or
versions to stay organized and not over-write their other files.

Users of other computer types (Macs, Unix, etc.) are recommended to use
a similar directory structure to organize their CSES files.

The following ZIP files are available to download from the Module 1 
download page under the Data Center on the CSES website.

All users should download the codebook file:

  cses1_codebook.zip  Contains the three codebook files, including this 
                      one, in text format.

Users should also download one or more of the following six files, 
depending on which statistical package(s) they intend to use with the 
data, and how:

  cses1_csv.zip       Contains a CSV file with variables names as column 
                      headers but no additional metadata (for instance,
                      no code labels are included).
                                      
  cses1_syntax.zip    Contains a raw data file and syntax statements to
                      read the dataset into SAS, SPSS, and STATA. The
                      instructions for doing so are found in the 
                      headers of the syntax files for each statistical
                      package: cses1.sas for SAS, cses1.sps for SPSS,
                      and cses1.do for STATA. This ZIP file also contains
                      optional missing data statements which can be 
                      applied to the dataset in SAS, SPSS, or STATA.
                      
  cses1_r.zip         Contains a R Workplace system file (.rdata), with
                      the dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into R. Missing data statements are not applied.
  
  cses1_sas.zip       Contains a SAS 7-8 system file (.sas7bdat), with
                      the dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into SAS. Missing data statements are not applied.
  
  cses1_spss.zip      Contains a SPSS system file (.sav), with the dataset
                      already prepared and ready to be loaded into SPSS.
                      Missing data statements are not applied.
  
  cses1_stata.zip     Contains a STATA 13 system file (.dta), with the
                      dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into STATA.  Missing data statements are not applied.

>>> SPECIAL DATA NOTES
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
))) IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each record in CSES Module 1 contains a number of identification variables
with which the analysis will wish to become familiar.

These three variables identify the dataset, version, and DOI:

    A1001    >>> DATASET
    A1002    >>> DATASET VERSION
    A1002_DOI>>> DIGITAL OBJECT IDENTIFIER

This variable uniquely identifies an election study across time. 
It appears in two variations:

    A1003    >>> ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (NUMERIC POLITY)
    A1004    >>> ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (ALPHABETIC POLITY)

This variable uniquely identifies a respondent across time:

    A1005    >>> ID VARIABLE - RESPONDENT

This variable uniquely identifies a polity (country, nation, etc.).
It appears in three variations:

    A1006    >>> ID COMPONENT - POLITY CSES CODE
    A1006_UN >>> ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN CODE
    A1006_NAM>>> ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    
Notes on their creation and use of these variables are available in the 
Variable Descriptions portion of the codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
))) WEIGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the variance in the sample designs used in the election studies
included in this project, the weights provided by the collaborators also
vary greatly. They are described in detail in variables A1010-A1014.
Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
that their analyses are weighted appropriately.

The original weights provided by the collaborators, where available, are:

    A1010_1  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    A1010_2  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    A1010_3  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: POLITICAL

The remainder of the weight variables in the dataset are derivative
variables, constructed from the original weights:

    A1011_1  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF SAMPLE WEIGHT
    A1011_2  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT
    A1011_3  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF POLITICAL WEIGHT
    A1012_1  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    A1012_2  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    A1012_3  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: POLITICAL
    A1013    >>> FACTOR: SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT
    A1014_1  >>> DATASET WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    A1014_2  >>> DATASET WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    A1014_3  >>> DATASET WEIGHT: POLITICAL


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MISSING DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the micro component of the project, there is some ambiguity regarding
which response categories have been included in the "missing" category
(usually indicated with a last digit of 9) in the component
election studies of the CSES project.  Researchers should be aware
that this category may include those who have refused to answer a
particular question, indicated that they "didn't know," were not asked
the question, or otherwise did not provide an answer to a particular item.

NOTES:  (1)  Multi-wave panel studies.  Only those respondents who
participated in the wave of the study that included the CSES Module are
included in the CSES core data-files.  Analysts should be aware that the
subsamples included in the CSES core data-files differ from the original
samples drawn in the following countries: Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic,
Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United States.  Analysts should
refer to the "Sample Design and Data Collection Reports" prepared by
the collaborators in these countries for more details.

(2)  Booster Samples.  In New Zealand and Great Britain, certain segments
of the population were over-sampled to allow for cross-group comparisons.
As the CSES module was not administered to these segments, these
respondents are not included in the CSES data-files.  However, as the
documentation provided by the collaborators refers to these "booster"
samples in some places, analysts should be aware of this feature of these
research designs.  Finally, where other component studies have
over-sampled segments of their populations, but administered the CSES
Module to all subsamples, these booster samples are included in the CSES
data-file.  In most cases where this has occurred, the collaborators have
provided weights that correct for this over-sampling in the estimation of
national parameters.  Analysts should pay particular attention to the
documentation provided for the weights in this codebook.

(3)  Russia.  The post-parliamentary and post-presidential data are drawn
from different waves of a multi-wave panel study.  As a result, the
respondents are the same, as indicated by the common case identification
codes, and can be compared across the 1999 and 2000 component studies.

))) ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES
===========================================================================

The following section provides:

(1).  General information about the election after which the CSES
Module 1 was administered.  In several cases, the election followed
the establishment of new electoral rules.  In several others, the
election marks a dramatic change in government.  This information is
provided with the intention of alerting the analyst to interesting
features of the election.  For more details, please refer to the
Macro Reports prepared by the collaborators, and available on the CSES
website.

(2).  General information about the research and sample designs of the
component election studies.  For example, in some cases, the CSES
module was adminstered in a later wave of a multi-wave study.  Also, in
Belgium, the CSES module was administered by different election study
teams in different regions of the country.  Finally, in several countries,
significant proportions of the population were excluded from the sample
frame, usually because of geographic isolation.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - AUSTRALIA (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "After five successive Federal election wins and thirteen
years in government, the ALP (led by the Prime Minister Paul Keating)
lost 31 seats, and the government, in the 2 March 1996 Federal election
for the 148 seat House of Representatives.  The Liberal and National
Parties (led by the Liberal Leader of the Opposition, John Howard)
gained 27 and 2 seats, respectively (independents gained 3), giving the
new coalition government 94 seats (Liberal 76 and Nationals 18), a
majority of 44 seats over the ALP...  Although many observers had
expected the government to lose the election (from February 1995 the
opinion polls had consistently shown the ALP trailing the Liberal-
National parties), most were surprised by the magnitude of the swing
to the coalition parties."  (CSES Macro Report: Australia).

(2) The sample was drawn from the Australian Electoral Rolls. As
enrolment is compulsory, nearly 95% of those eligible are included
in the sample frame.  The sample is stratified by region, and the
AEC identified sample points using a systematic random selection m
echanism (interval count).  The identified respondents were contacted
three times before being declared a non-interview.  No replacement
methods were used.

(1) This study was conducted following nearly concurrent legislative
(October 15, 2000; repeated March 18, 2001) and presidential (September
9, 2001) elections.  The evaluation (Parties and Leaders), candidate
recall, and macro data items pertain to the legislative election, although
only presidential vote choice is reported.

(2)  Households were randomly selected, and then
respondents were identified according to the "next birthday" method.
Households were contacted 3 times over two days before it was declared
a non-interview.  No replacement methods were used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Following the 1995 election, public confidence in the governing
institutions was seriously shaken by several scandals involving
members of the governing coalition.  Spontaneous strikes occurred
throughout this period, with the largest, the "White March,"
involving 300 000 protesters.  Immigration and asylum remain
contentious issues.  In Flanders, the disaffection with the governing
parties benefitted the VLD, which became the largest party in the
Flemish region.

(2) Although the Belgium-Flanders and Belgium-Walloon election studies
were very similar, the data were collected and deposited by different
teams of researchers. Further, the party systems are exclusive. As a
result, in the CSES datafiles the Flanders and Walloon components are
treated as distinct elections.  However, to facilitate comparisons
across these components, wherever possible, similar coding schemes
have been used.

(3) The Belgium-Flanders (1999) election study includes the Flemish-
speaking portion of Brussels.

(4) Some of the respondents were panel respondents (1460) who
cooperated in 1991 and (or) 1995 and the other part was a
cross-section (718).  For the cross section (and for the first
use of the panel in 1991) a two stage sampling procedure was used.
Primary units were municipalities, selected according to their
population size.  Secondary units were selected at random within
the primary units, from the electoral registers.   Replacement of
the new sample points from within the same municipality occurred
after attempts to contact the respondent were unsuccessful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Following the 1995 election, public confidence in the governing
institutions was seriously shaken by several scandals involving
members of the governing coalition.  Spontaneous strikes occurred
throughout this period, with the largest, the "White March,"
involving 300 000 protesters.  Immigration and asylum remain
contentious issues.  Unlike in Flanders, the challenging parties
made only modest gains in Walloon.  PS remained large enough to
ensure a place in the governing coalition.  It should be noted that
Ecolo nearly doubled its share of the vote in both Wallonia and
Brussels.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CANADA (1997)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1997 Federal Election marks the consolidation
of the radical changes in the Canadian party system that occurred in
the 1993 election.  Following the Progressive Conservative
government's failure to ratify the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, and
as a result of general dissatisfaction with the Mulroney government,
the Progressive Conservatives were reduced from 170 seats to only 2
seats in 1993, losing official party status.  Although the
Progressive Conservatives did regain official party status in the 1997
election, its presence remains over-shadowed by two new parties, the
Bloc Quebecois (which formed her Majesty's Loyal Opposition following
the 1993 election) and the Reform Party (first elected in 1993, and
the official opposition party following the 1997 election).  With the
emergence of these new parties, Canadian party politics has become
highly regionalized: Bloc Quebecois candidates stand for election
exclusively in Quebec.  The Reform Party's stronghold is in the
Western provinces, particularly Alberta and British Colombia, in spite
of efforts to gain standing in central Canada.  The Liberal's support
is drawn almost exclusively from Ontario where, in 1997, Liberal
candidates were elected in 101 out of 103 constituencies.

(2)  It is also important to note that this was the first election
following the 1995 referendum on secession in Quebec.  Following
the narrow defeat of the referendum (by a margin of less than 1%),
the charismatic leader and founding member of the federal
Bloc Quebecois, Lucien Bouchard stepped down to lead the provincial
Parti Quebecois and was replaced by Gilles Duceppe.

(3) The CES was conducted in three panels (Refer to The 1997
Canadian Election Survey: Technical Documentation).  An origi1al sample
(n=3949) was drawn in the pre-election period.  These respondents were
re-interviewed following the election (n=3170).  Finally, a mailback
survey that contained the CSES module was sent to the respondents;
1857 returned the study. Note, all 3949 of the original respondents are
included in the CSES datafiles.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CHILE (1999)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Through this presidential election, Ricardo Lagos, became the third
consecutive president from the center-left coalition, and the first
socialist president, since the reestablishment of democracy.

The elections were held in a critical economic situation; the rates of
unemployment and crime were high; and there were a set of demonstrations
performed by students and indigenous people. The possibility of Pinochet
being judged overseas provoked nationalistic anger among the majority of
the population, who demanded a more active intervention of the government
to bring him back to the country.  The first round showed a tight result
between the two main candidates. Lagos got 0.05% of votes over Joaquin
Lavin, the candidate for the right-wing alliance. The government candidate
was favored by a decline in the unemployment rate and by Pinochet's obvious
release a month before the second round. Finally, Lagos got 2.60% more
votes than Lavin.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  "The election... illustrated the remarkable political
stability of the Czech Republic and saw some significant concentration
of the party spectrum and the emergence of an effective democratic
opposition." (Fitzmaurice (1997), "The 1996 Czech Elections,"  Electoral
Studies)

(2) The CSES module was contained in the post-election panel of the study.
The original sample included 1589; 1229 participated in the later wave
and are included in the CSES datafiles.

(3) In the first stage of selection, a sample of 300 localities
(stratified by size) was randomly selected.  Then, respondents were
identified according to quotas based on age, gender and education.
3 contacts were made before a sample point was declared a non-interview.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - DENMARK (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The previous minority coalition government led by the Social
Democratic Party, and  that also includes the Social Liberal Party,
won the general election in March 1998 with a majority of one in the
parliament.  Voters' deep concern about Denmark's membership in the
EU is in part due to  a lack of confidence in the long-run stability
of European economies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GERMANY (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) This election marks the end of the Chancellorship of Helmut
Kohl, and reflects the general disenchantment with the CDU.  The CDU
was supported by less than a third of the popular vote.  The new
government was formed by the SPD in coalition with the Greens, under
the charismatic, "post-modern" leadership of Gerhard Schroeder.

(2) This is an RDD sample, with random selection within the household.
12 contacts were made before a sample point was declared a non-interview.
No replacement methods were used.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (1997)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Following Black Wednesday, voter confidence in the government
declined dramatically, bolstering support for parties previously
in opposition.

(2) This study is accurately referred to in this documentation as "Great
Britain," rather than the United Kingdom, because the study includes
England, Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland.  Please refer to the
"Sample Design and Data Collection Report" for details of the complicated
sample design used.  In particular, note that the Scottish "booster" sample
is not included in the CSES datafiles.

(3) The sample frame includes eligible voters in Britain.  The PSUs are
postal sectors, stratified by sub-region and according to population
density and socioeconomic profile, selected in probabilities
proportionate to size (systematic random selection), treating
England/Wales, and Scotland separately.  Interviewers determined the
household and respondents according to Kish grids.   A minimum of four
re-contacts occurred.  No replacement methods were used.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - HONG KONG (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Turnout for the first elections since Hong Kong was transferred from
Great Britain to the People's Republic of China was higher than at any
election conducted under British rule.  The resulting legislative body is
one with a much stronger pro-Beijing presence when compared to previous
elections.  At the same time, the success of candidates and parties
previously ousted by the Beijing-appointed Provisional Legislative Council
suggests the emergence of a pro-local autonomy and full democracy vs.
pro-Beijing cleavage in electoral politics.

(2) Based on the final registers of electors of 1998, the Registration
and Electoral Office helped select randomly 8,000 registered electors
in proportion to size by consistency.  Potential respondents were
contacted 3 times before being declared a non-sample.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - HONG KONG (2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The second legislative council election was characterized by concerns
about producing a council broadly viewed as legitimate. The number of
members from geographical constituencies was increased from 20 to 24, and
the number returned by an election committee was reduced from 10 to 6.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - HUNGARY (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) In the 1998 Hungarian election, the FIDESZ-MPP, an
oppositional party since 1990, challenged the governing Hungarian
Socialist Party. Although the FIDESZ-MPP was supported by the
majority of the popular vote and won a plurality of the seats in the
legislature, it was necessary to form a coalition with the FKGP and
the MDF to form a government.

(2)  There was some concern, prior to the 1998 Hungarian election,
that the notorious complexity of Hungarian electoral rules, combined
with a large number of parties and candidates, would bewilder voters.
In fact, turnout for the first round was considerably low (roughly 60%).
However, turnout did increase during the second round, when the FIDESZ-
MPP withdrew many of its non-winning candidates in support of coalition
partners, and concluded numerous electoral agreements with other
parties.  "For the first time in Hungary's post-communist politics, the
party which won the largest regional list vote and was ahead in the
constituencies after the first round [the FIDESZ-MPP] failed to emerge
as the overall winner" (Fowler, B. , "Hungarian Parliamentary
Elections, May 1998," Electoral Studies 17:2, 257-262).

(3) In Hungary, the CSES module was administered in the post-election
wave of a panel study. Some of the demographic data in the CSES data set
(marital status, religion, religiosity, church attendance, size of
household, family income) were obtained from the pre-election wave. Note
that the "post-election" wave was actually carried out between the two
rounds of the election that were separated by two weeks in 1998. The
reason for this choice was the worry that after the second round many more
respondents would fail to correctly remember which party they supported on
the list, which one in their single-member districts in the first round,
and which in the runoff in the single-members.

(4) Localities were stratified by county and population size, and selected
with probabilities proportionate to size.  Households were selected
via random walks.  Respondents were selected with Kish grids from within
the household.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ICELAND (1999)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) An interesting feature of the 1999 parliamentary election was the effort
of parties on the left to form a united front, consisting of a union of
the People's Alliance, the Social Democratic Party, and the Women's
Alliance, to challenge the conservative Independence Party.  However, the
leaders of the Alliance were unable to accommodate those farthest to the
left, and lost supporters to the newly emergent Left-Greens.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ISRAEL (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Israelis directly elected their Prime Minister for the
first time in these elections.  Prior the 1996 election, the Prime
Minister was selected by the legislature, as is customary in
parliamentary systems.  With these reforms, the Prime Minister and
the legislature are elected concurrently, but by separate ballots
for four year terms.

(2) Data pertaining to the 1996 Prime Ministerial elections are
reported in variables otherwise assigned to presidential variables.

(3) As new information regarding the handling of the Israeli data was
brought forward by the collaborator, there are signficant revisions
to several of the variables, resulting in distributions which differ
from earlier versions of the CSES datafiles.

(4) 3 samples were drawn from telephone listings.  When, after 3
contacts, the entire sample had been used, interviewers proceeded
to the second, and then third lists.  This procedure was followed
in the selection of a general sample (Jewish and Russian sample),
and an Arab sample.  The response rate among the Arab population was
much higher, and as a result, the third list was not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - JAPAN (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  "The 1996 General Election was conducted under a new mixed
system.  Each voter casts two separate votes: one for the single
member districts and one for the PR districts." (CSES Marco. Level
Survey: Japan).

(2)  Further, as the previous election (1993) ended the 38-year reign
of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 1996 election marked a dramatic
change in party system dynamics.  During the last government and over
the course of the campaign, the traditional opposition party, the JSP,
collapsed, several new parties formed, and prominent politicians
"crossed the floor." (Reed (1997), "The 1996 Japanese General Election",
Electoral Studies 16:1)

(3) The CSES items were contained in the post-election wave of a
panel study.  The original sample includes 1535 respondents; 1327
completed the post-election survey and are included in the CSES
datafiles.

(4) Most of the questions were asked out of sequence in the pre- and the
post-election waves.  See Table 1 for the order of CSES questions placed
in the Japanese survey.

      Table 1

      'A' for JEDS96 denotes pre-election wave and 'B' denotes
      post-election wave.  The numbers that follow A or B are
      question numbers.

(5) Pre-election only cases from the Japanese survey are not included
in the CSES Japanese data.

(6) First, the prefectures are divided into 11 districts, which
correspond to the 11 PR districts for the General Election for the
House of Representatives.  In each district, cities and towns/villages
were divided into the strata according to their population size.
2,100 census tracts were selected (via systematic sampling) from these
52 strata in proportion to the census population estimates.  Finally,
the secondary sampling units (individual respondents) were chosen by
the systematic sampling from the voter registration list (in come cases
from the residential register) in each designated primary sampling unit.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - LITHUANIA (1997)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Political parties and their presidential candidates were
not the central actors in this presidential election.  Instead, the
two candidates who proceeded to the second round of the run-off
elections were not affiliated with any of the major parties, but ran
as independents.

(2)  The sample was stratified according to the ethnic regions of
Lithuanian.  Then, 104 clusters were randomly selected in strata,
according to the size of the settlement. Finally, Kish tables were
used to identify respondents within the household.  3 attempts to
contact the respondents were made before a sample point was declared
a non-interview.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - MEXICO (1997)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  This election marks the demise of what some observers
have called "hegemonic" PRI rule.  Prior to this election, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party ruled longer than any other party
in the world, controlling the presidency, and the congress since they
was established in 1929.

(2)  Electoral reforms implemented with the 1996 election reduced
party thresholds for seat eligibility to 2%.  Further, no party can
be over represented in terms of seats in the Chamber by more than 8%.
As a result, a party must receive at least 42% of the popular vote
in order to form a majority government.  The PRI anticipated (wrongly)
that they would be supported by that at least that proportion.

(3) Changes have been made in the handling of the missing data from the
past release. Therefore, some variables in this release might have
a different distribution from the ones included in the past release.

(4)  The primary sampling units were the municipalities. The
municipalities were chosen within each electoral stratum, using
a systematic method with probabilities proportional to size.  The
second-stage sampling units were the AGEBS (Basic Geo-statistical
units) for urban cases, or the localities for rural cases. They were
chosen randomly with probability proportional to their size. The
measuring of the unit's size was the population over 18 years old.
The respondent selected within the household was the person over 18
years old, whose birthday was the most proximate to the date of the
interview.  Substitutes were randomly selected after 3 failed attempts
to contact the designated respondent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - MEXICO (2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) These elections marked the end of 71 years of rule by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). The country's economic situation was good,
after recovering from the 1994 economic crisis, people were being employed
and the economy was starting to grow.

The main opposition candidate, Vicente Fox, started a campaign to be his
party's, National Action Party (PAN), candidate three years before the
election. Fox was finally the candidate of a coalition between his
right-wing party, PAN, and the Green Party (PVEM). The other opposition
candidate, Cuauhemoc Cardenas, was supported by a coalition formed by his
party, Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), and a group of smaller less
important parties. At the beginning of the electoral process the main
opposition parties tried to build an electoral alliance, but it was not
possible because neither Fox nor Cardenas were willing to step down of the
competition. The candidate from the governing party, Francisco Labastida,
had served as governor of Sinaloa and as Minister of Energy, Agriculture
and Government.

The strategy followed by Fox was to present himself as the symbol of the
change. He moved on the political spectrum more to the center, in order
to attract center-left voters and young people. This election was the first
in which the members of the PRI elected their candidate, because President
Zedillo refused to continue the practice of choosing his successor. For the
first time, there were televised debates among the candidates. Although the
polls showed that the competition among Labastida and Fox was going to be
tight, Fox got 6.4% votes over Labastida.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  In the prior election, the traditional governing party, the
Christian Democrats suffered a tremendous loss of 20 seats.  With only
34 seats (out of 150), the CDA were excluded from the 1994 Cabinet.  In
the 1998 election, the CDA lost 5 more seats, bolstering the electoral
strength of the so-called 'Purple Coalition' government, formed by
the Labor Party (whose color is red), and the Liberals (whose color
is blue).

(2)  With regards to party dynamics and campaigns, it is worth
noting that TV ads made their first appearance in this Dutch election.
Only recently, has commercial television been introduced in the
Netherlands;  in past elections, parties were given equal amounts of
time on public networks.  The Socialist Party was the first party to
announce its intention to 'buy time' on a commercial station.  The
Democrats 66 attempted to convince the other parties not to purchase
time, but when they refused, D66 became the first party to produce
an ad. (Irwin (1999), "The Dutch Parliamentary Election of 1998,"
Electoral Studies 18:1, 271-300).

(3)  New electoral reforms allowed candidates to be elected if
(s)he received one-quarter of the electoral quotient (prior to this
the threshold had been one-half), regardless of their position on
party lists.  As a result, two members were elected despite lower
positions on the party lists than their parties' quotients allowed.
Prior to this reform, only three members had been elected in this
way. (Irwin (1999), "The Dutch Parliamentary Election of 1998,"
Electoral Studies 18:1, 271-300).

(4) The Dutch Parliamentary Election Study consisted of both a
pre-election wave and a post-election wave, together with supplementary
data collections (e.g. for non-response cases).  CSES variables are split
between pre-election and post-election data. 287 cases from the Dutch
pre-election study were not re-interviewed in the post-election study.

(5) A sample frame of municipalities was stratified according to
region and population density.  Within selected municipalities,
respondents were identified by SRS from electoral rolls.  Random
replacement of municipalities occurred when the municipalities were
unwilling to cooperate.  There was no maximum number of contact attempts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1996 election began a new electoral regime for New
Zealanders.  Prior to the 1996 election, legislators were elected in
single member districts, and the legislature was structured according
to the Westminster model.  However, following a referendum on electoral
reform held in 1992, the legislature was restructured according to
a plurality-PR model.  In voting for the lower house, New Zealanders
now select both a candidate and a party list (similarly to German
electoral procedures).

(2) There are several sample components:  First, a post-election new
sample was drawn from the electoral rolls.  Those registered on the
Maori rolls were over-sampled.  Second, a pre-post election sample
includes the VAP, and was drawn via RDD in the pre-election wave.  A
mail-back survey, containing the CSES module, was sent to members of
each of these samples.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NORWAY (1997)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  "The election was characterized by great volatility and
unclear  alternatives.  It resulted in an unexpected change of
government.  Although Labor remained the largest party, the incumbent
Labor government resigned after the election and was replaced by a
mini-coalition of three parties at the center, the Christian People's
Party, the Center (Agrarian) party and the Liberals."  (Valen (1997),
"Norway: The Storting Election of September 15, 1997,"  Electoral
Studies 555-60).

(2) Municipalities were stratified into 109 strata, and one was selected
from each stratum.  Individuals were randomly selected (systematically)
from the population registers for each municipality.  Four contacts were
made before the sample point was declared a non-interview.  No replacement
methods were used.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - PERU (2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 2000 legislative election is notable for the instability
of the party system:  With the exception of "Change '90," and "Nueva
Mayoria" that were both part of the successful "Peru 2000" alliance,
no party that contested the 1995 election received more than 7.5% of
the vote.

(2) It is also important to note the highly personalized nature of this
election:  Fujimori was re-elected for a third term, in violation of
the constitution.  Peru 2000 rallied in his support, and the campaigns
of all parties centered largely on this issue.

(3)  Finally, it should be noted that there were "serious limits"
imposed on the media throughout the campaign period.

(4) In the first stage of sample selection, PSUs were randomly
selected.  Respondents were identified according to demographic
quotas.  2 attempts were made to contact each respondent.  No
replacement methods were used.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - POLAND (1997)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1997 Polish election marks the first alternation in
government since the collapse of the Soviet regime.  The Solidarity
Election Action (AWS) replaced the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in
both houses, with a slightly larger proportion of the popular vote and
a plurality of seats in both legislative chambers.  In coalition with
the Freedom Union (itself an alliance of the former Democratic Union,
and the Liberal Democratic Congress), AWS formed the government.

(2) It seems that the AWS victory comes largely at the defeat of the
Polish Peasant Party (PSL), a former coalition partner of the SLD:
In the 1997 election, the PSL was reduced to 27 seats (from 132). Some
observers credit the PSL's resistance to economic reforms as the source
of the electorate's disenchantment with this party (Chan, K. (1997),
"The Polish General Election of 1997,"  Electoral Studies 17:4, 561-567).

(3) Statistical districts (defined by the Main Statistical Office)
were selected with probabilities proportionate to size.  Households
were then randomly selected from  within these districts.  3 contact
attempts were made.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Following relatively poor results for the Socialist Party (PS) in the
local elections held on December 2001, Prime Minister Guterres tendered
his resignation. The legislative elections of 17 March 2002 spelled the
end of Socialist Party rule, which lost 19 MPs and the victory, albeit
without an absolute majority, of the centre-right party, the PSD, which
elected 81 MPs, out of a possible 230. The elections also led to the
formation of a coalition government, after 15 years of single-party
government, between the PSD and the right-wing CDS/PP. Nevertheless,
the alternation in power, as well as the change in government type,
did not represent a fundamental shift in voting behaviour, as seen by
national and district party results.

(2) This sample was stratified by NUTS II (5 regions in the mainland:
North, Centre, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Alentejo and Algarve) and
HABITAT (eleven categories of localities by number of inhabitants:
less than 100 ; 101 to 200 ; 201 to 500 ; 501 to 1000 ; 1001 to 2000;
2001 to 5000 ; 5001 to 10.000; 10.001 to 20.000 ; 20.001 to 100.000 ;
100.001 to 500.000; more than 500.001).  For each cell within the NUTS
II and HABITAT frame, and according to the proportion of residents in
each cell, the number of interviews was defined. Then, the number of
localities inside each cell of the same frame was randomly selected,
trying to ensure that no more than 10 interviews were done in the same
locality. So, for example, if according to the number of residents in a
cell of the frame, 100 interviews had to be carried out, 10 localities
in that cell were selected. In each locality, the method of random route
was used, in order to ensure a good distribution of the selected
households, for all the extension of the locality.  In the household,
respondents were selected using the following criteria: next person living
in the household to have his/her birthday.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1996 Romanian legislative election is notable for the
emergence of the Democratic Social Party of Romania (PDSR), and the
National Peasant's Christian and Democratic Party (PNTC). Both of these
parties made considerable gains in this election; the PDSR formed the
government in coalition with other leftist parties, including the former
governing Romanian Social Democratic Party.

(2)  Localities were randomly selected from strata defined by region
and size.  Then, electoral lists were randomly selected from within
each locality, and respondents were selected from each list.  After
three unsuccessful attempts to contact a particular respondent, a
randomly selected substitute was interviewed instead.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - RUSSIA (2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The Russian party system has yet to be institutionalized in the sense
that voters, candidates, and parties have learned to behave strategically
vis-`-vis the electoral rules.  In this election however, the 6 parties
that passed the PR threshold had received 81% of the vote between them,
and the distribution of seats among the party closely reflects the
percentage of the vote each had gained.  However, given the sheer number
of parties and candidates, especially independent candidates, who competed
in the single-member districts, there were many victories with only a low
plurality.

The new "Unity" party, an alliance established in September 1999 to
represent the Government in the elections, won 72 seats or 23 percent, 67
of which were gained through party-list proportional representation. The
Communist Party, however, lost 44 seats while retaining 113.

(2) Very early in the race, Putin, with an agenda that called for a strong
state and properly functioning market economy, emerged as the clear
frontrunner.

(3) This component of the CSES project is taken from part of a three-wave
panel study:  The pre-election wave was fielded throughout November and
December, 1999 (n=1919).  A post-legislative election study was conducted
following the parliamentary elections held in December, 1999 (n=1842).
Finally, the respondents were interviewed a third time, following the
presidential election in March, 2000. The CSES battery was carried (almost
in entirety) in both the post-legislative and post-presidential election
studies.  The post-legislative data are included in the CSES datafiles.
Although panel attrition was relatively slight, analysts should refer to
the "Sample Design and Data Collection Report," available through the
CSES Country Archive for details.

Note, also, that the demographic items are taken from the pre-legislative
wave of the study.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SLOVENIA (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  In the 1996 Slovenian election, the governing Slovene
Christian Democratic Party (SKD) and United List of Social Democrats
(ZLSD) were replaced by the Slovene People's Party (SLS), and the Social
Democrats (SDS).  In spite of this instability in the party system,
there seems to be some consensus among the parties regarding the
direction of Slovenia's nation-building efforts.  As one observer
remarks, "this was a routine election at which no existential issues
were at stake" (Fitzmaurice, J.  (1997) "The Slovenian Parliamentary
Elections of 10 November 1996,"  Electoral Studies 16:3, 403-407).

(2) The Central Register of Population (a list of names and addresses
constantly updated by public administration) is employed as a sampling
frame. The sample is a three-stage systematic sample with random start.
The target sample size was N=2100 (140 primary and 420 secondary
sampling units).  Systematic sample with start from primary sampling
units of k=1200.  Third stage sample is systematic sample of k=10 with
start from second stage units. Individual persons with name and address
are selected on a final stage.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) This election was characterized by high voter cynicism and a marked
decline in turnout.  The growing salience of issues was a departure from
the authoritarian style of politics that has characterized politics.
Salient issues included the pace with which the nation should approach the
restructuring of the economy, political reform and democratization.

In an effort to cut costs, the number of contested seats was reduced to
273,from 299 in the previous election.  As in previous elections,
regionalism continued as one of the strongest factors impacting electoral
outcomes.  However, the election signaled a weakening hold of current
political bosses Kim Dae Jung, Kim Young-Sam, and Kim Jong-pil.
Independent candidates won seats in President Kim Dae Jung's south-western
region; the DPP, as a new party formed by GNP politicians not nominated
by their party, emerged in Kim Young-Sam's south-eastern region; and Kim
Jong-pil was unsuccessful helping the ULD to retain seats in Chungchong.

(2) Note, there are some regions excluded from the sample frame: Cheju
island and other small islands. This is a usual practice for Korean
national surveys, since people in these regions are difficult and
costly to contact while occupying a very small percentage of the whole
population.  To devise the sample frame, Electoral districts were
randomly selected.  Then, for each electoral district, a quota of
respondents was determined reflecting the whole population distribution
in terms of age and sex.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SPAIN (2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1996 election marks a significant turning point in
Spanish electoral history:  Since the 1982 election, the Socialist
Party (PSOE) had governed with an absolute majority of seats in the
legislature.  However, in 1996, the People's Party (PP) gained a
plurality of seats in the Chamber of Deputies.  In coalition with
regional parties, the PP maintained parliamentary support, and
broadened its electoral support in the subsequent 2000 election.

(2)  In the 2000 election, the People's Party (PP) gained an absolute
majority in Congress, allowing it to govern without the additional
votes of the Catalan or Basque nationalists.


(3) PSUs were randomly selected, and then a random route method was
used.  If a selected respondent within the household was unavailable,
another housing unit along the same route was selected.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SWEDEN (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1998 Swedish election is the first since a shift to
a four-year parliamentary term (previously, Swedish parliaments sat for
two years).  Note that turnout was the lowest in this election of all
Swedish elections held since 1958 (Ater, D. (1999), "The Swedish General
Election of the 20th September 1998: victory for values over policies,"
Electoral Studies 18:2, 296-300).

(2) "The sample has been drawn disproportionally. For in depth comparative
purposes, 3 cantons (ZH, GE, TI) are over represented. Cantonal
proportionality in the national data requires this backlog to be deleted.
Thus, the data set includes 2048, instead of 3257 cases."


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SWITZERLAND (1999)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  In the 1999 Swiss election, the Swiss People's Party gained
15 seats (largely at the expense of smaller, more radical parties).
Observers credit this gain to their concentration on the issue of
political asylum in Switzerland, an issue stemming from the recent
influx of refugees from Kosovo.

(2) Households were selected from the Swisscom directory (private
lines: number and addresses), in two stages, with disproportional
random sampling.  Then, after screening according to the age of
contacted person, the structure of household (number of persons,
number of persons with right to vote, name, age, sex and nationality
of each person), respondents were randomly selected.  Between 30 and
50 contact attempts were made.  No replacement methods were used.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - TAIWAN (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  In the 1996 election, Taiwanese voters elected, for the first
time, their President and Vice-President for a four year term. Prior to
this election, the President and Vice-President were elected by members
of the legislature.  The incumbent, Lee Tung-hui was re-elected with a
considerable lead over his opponents.

(2)  The sampling frame consists of eligible voters residing on the
mainland.  Strata were defined by region, with concern for the
representation of major municipalities.  From these strata, PSUs were
sampled with probabilities proportionate to size.  Electoral districts
were randomly identified, and then respondents were selected from within
these districts according to the electoral rolls.  9 such samples were
drawn.  If the original respondent could not be interviewed, a replacement
from an alternative sample, of similar demographic characteristics from
within the district was interviewed as a substitute.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - THAILAND (2001)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 6 January, 2001 Thai voters cast their ballots in the first election
for members to the House of Representatives to be held under the 16th
Constitution, passed in October 1997.  The new constitution increased the
number of seats from 392 to 500, with 100 MPs elected from a nation-wide
party list and 400 from single member constituencies.

(2) Although the design corresponds to a pre-election/post-election panel
study, many of the CSES items are drawn from the pre-election phase.  Where
there is reason to believe that this may affect analysis of these data,
those items that are obtained from the pre-election study are noted in the
relevant variables' documentation.

(3) The sample was drawn in the following manner: First, the population
was stratified by region. Each region was to produce 250 respondents.
Then, a systematic sample of polling units was drawn from within each
region.  Finally, a systematic sample of eligible voters was drawn from
the polling units selected in each region.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - UKRAINE (1998)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  The 1994 Ukrainian election demonstrated the inability of the
electoral system established following the collapse of the Soviet regime
to produce stable, competitive electoral politics.  Because of
the enormous obstacles facing candidates (to gain a seat, they required
an absolute majority of the popular vote cast by an absolute majority of
the electorate), nearly half of the seats were left unfilled, and only
half of the legislators elected in 1994 were  members of political
parties. As a result, the government dramatically reformed the electoral
system, and new electoral law was adopted in 1997.  Under these new
regulations, half of the seats were elected by single member districts,
and the other half through proportional representation. The 1998
election  was the first held under these electoral rules.  In spite of
these reforms however, half of the members elected in the single-member
districts were independent (without party affiliation).

(2) The first stage of sampling design is grouping of the oblasts,
which are the main units of territorial and administrative division
of Ukraine, into regions. The grouping is made on the basis of more
than 150 characteristics and indicators of economic, social and cultural
development by methods of factor analysis and cluster analysis applied
in sequence. The second stage of the sampling design is a selection of
urban and rural settlements.  The task of the second stage is to select
32-35 urban settlements to represent on the one hand, the structure of
the urban settlements of Ukraine and, on the other hand, to represent
each of the 10 regions singled out at the first stage of sampling design.
For this, within each region the cities and towns belonging to the same
group are put in alphabetical order and selected at random.  At the third
stage, urban sampling points are divided into so-called "rayons"
(territorial divisions).  Streets for the interviewers' routes are
selected at the fourth stage.  The number of the streets selected within
each district should correspond to the number of routes. If no districts
were selected within the urban settlement, the streets selected should be
distant from each other. This should also give the possibility to study
opinions of people living in multi-storied buildings, detached private
houses, etc. Each route should cover not more than 10 interviews. The
number of houses should not be less than 10 for each route.  Rural
settlements are selected randomly from the list of the rural settlements
of the same oblasts to which the cities selected to represent the urban
population belong.  The last (fifth) stage of the sampling procedure is
selection of the respondents by quota task.   It is not clear whether
multiple attempts were made to contact respondents, or what replacement
methods were used.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - UNITED STATES (1996)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "The American elections of 1996 proved to be a curious
anticlimax" (Shafer, B. (1996), "The American Elections of 1996,"
Electoral Studies 16:3, 394-403).  It seems that the 1996 election
mirrored the 1992 election in most respects:  The Democrat
presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, won with a comfortable majority
of electoral college votes (though without a majority of the popular
vote);  the Republican candidate, Bob Dole,  failed to close the
popularity gap between himself and the presidency (though the
Republicans did gain some of Ross Perot's, an independent candidate,
support).  There is one notable difference from the 1992 election:
In 1992, an overwhelming majority of elected congressmen were
Democrats, while in the 1996 election the Republicans maintained
the majority presence in Congress that they had gained in the 1994
midterm elections.

(2) The 1996 National Election Study entailed both a pre-election interview
and a post-election re-interview.  About three-fourths of the 1996 cases
consist of empaneled respondents who were first interviewed in the 1994 or
1992 National Election Study.  A freshly drawn cross-section sample makes
up the balance of the 1996 cases.  (Details of the sample design are given
in "Sample Design of the 1996 Pre/Post Election Studies", in Appendix B.)
Altogether, 1714 citizens were interviewed in the 9 weeks prior to the
November 5, 1996 election. To permit analysis of the impact of the
unfolding election campaign, the pre-election sample was divided into four
subsample replicates, which were released approximately two weeks apart.
1316 of the pre-election interviews were conducted with panel respondents;
398 with cross-section respondents.  In the weeks following the election,
1534 pre-election respondents were reinterviewed: 1197 panel, 337
cross-section.

(3) The selection of primary stage sampling units (PSUs), which
depending on the sample stratum are either MSAs, single counties or
groupings of small counties, is based on the county-level 1980 Census
Reports of Population and Housing. A three-step process of ordering the
SSUs within the primary areas produced an implicit stratification of the
area segments in the second-stage sampling frame, stratified at the
county level by geographic location and population.  For each area
segment selected in the second sampling stage, a listing was made of
all housing units located within the physical boundaries of the segment.
The final equal probability sample of housing units for the 1994 NES was
systematically selected from the housing unit listings for the sampled
area segments.    Note, half of the respondents were randomly assigned
to telephone interviews in a mode experiment.  Extensive attempts were
made to contact respondents before a sample point was declared
non-interview.
