))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING FULL RELEASE
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "Full Release"
of CSES Module 4 (2011-2016).

Users of the Final Release may wish to monitor the errata for
CSES Module 4 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which may 
impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES Module 4, go to the Data
Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 4 download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the gray box to the right of the page.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 3: PARTIES AND LEADERS"
===========================================================================

Part 3 of the CSES Codebook identifies the parties/coalitions participating  
during a polity's national election and/or those participating in the 
polity's previous national election. It also details the leaders 
of parties/coalitions and/or presidential candidates (where applicable) 
for the most important parties/coalitions.
Part 3 also lists the party identifiers in other comparative projects, 
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, formerly
the Comparative Manifesto Project) and the Parliament and Government 
(ParlGov) database. This will allow easy data bridging between CSES and 
these other projects. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 4 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES Module 4 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "D" 
(D being the fourth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
Module 4).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programmes. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

For further details on the CSES Module 4 documentation, users are advised
to consult part 1 of the CSES Codebook. 


===========================================================================
))) CSES NAMING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS CONVENTION
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and 
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding 
schemes. The details of each party/leader classification are available in 
Part 3 of the CSES Codebook. 


<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING 

All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. These codes are used to Identify the following: 
   - who a respondent's voted for in the current election (variable D3006). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (variable D3008).
   - the respondent's party identification (variable D3018).
   - the extent of institutional contact the respondent received from a 
     party/coalition during the election campaign (variable D3021).

The numeric coding is also used to identify macro-level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely:  
   - which party/coalition held the presidency before and after the 
     elections (variable D5007 and D5011). 
   - which party/coalition held the prime ministership before and after 
     the elections (variable D5008 and D5012). 

Where possible, the numeric codes assigned to parties/coalitions are 
consistent for the current and previous election. However, for the previous
election (variable D3008) different codes might have been allocated for the
same parties (for example a party in the current election might be standing
as party of a coalition but previously stood alone). Users are advised to
consult the election study notes for variable D3008 for each country where
details of deviations are noted. 


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition 
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most votes
etc...         

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable D3011). 
   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable D3013).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral 
     district (variable D4003). 
   - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
     (variables D5001, D5002, & D5005).
   - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
     (variables D5003 & D5004).
   - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios 
     before and after the election (variable D5009 & D5013).
   - expert judgments by the national collaborators of the 
     said party/coalition's ideological family (variable D5016).
   - expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable D5017).


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e.: Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...)

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable D3012). 


===========================================================================
))) PARTIES AND LEADER CLASSIFICATIONS FOR CSES MODULE 4 BY POLITY
===========================================================================

All parties/coalitions or presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. Alphabetical codes are assigned to select parties and 
leaders (see above description on how parties/coalitions and leaders are
coded by the CSES). 

The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical order. CSES provides
the name of the party/coalition in the original language, the English 
version of the party/coalition name, and the party abbreviation, where
avaialble. Leaders are only listed for parties where we have accompanying 
leader likeability data available. Polities are listed in alphabetical 
order. The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical order. 

Users are advised to pay particular attention to ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
listed below each polity's party and leader list for additional information
regarding data availability and deviations.

         |
         | In total, there are 200 seats in the Finnish parliament. One
         | representative was elected from the autonomous, Swedish-speaking  
         | Aland Islands. Since the 2015 national election study in Finland
         | did not sample respondents from the electoral district of Aland,
         | CSES did not assign a code to the Aland Coalition to which this
         | one representative belongs to. 
         |
         | Three alliances formed for the election but only to compete in
         | one and not all districts. ALLIANCE 1 was made up of the 
         | Christian Democrats (KD) and "For the Cause of the Poor" and 
         | fought in the Helsinki constituency only. ALLIANCE 2 was made up  
         | of the National Coalition Party (KOK) and the Swedish People's 
         | Party (RKP) and fought in the Varsinais-Suomi constituency only.
         | ALLIANCE 3 was made up of the Finns Party (PS) and the Christian
         | Democrats (KD) and fought in the Lapland constituency only (see 
         | also election study note for variable D5032 in Variable Section, 
         | Part 2 of the CSES Codebook).

         | When PARTY 2 (New Anticapitalist Party - NPA) was founded, LPR
         | was closed down. However, they are closely connected through
         | their memberships.
         |       
         | In the 2012 French election, the likeability of Presidential 
         | candidates for each party was measured, rather than the 
         | likeability of each party's leader.
         |
         | PARTY D (Left Front - PG) was an electoral coalition of Parti
         | Gauche (PG) and Parti Communiste de France (PCR). All questions 
         | in the France (2012) election study referred to this electoral 
         | coalition Front de Gauche, or its presidential candidate, 
         | Jean-Luc Melenchon. The only exception is D3018_3, in which the
         | respondents mention to be close to Parti Gauche, PG, solely.
         |
         | Two additional alliances formed. ALLIANCE 1 (no official name)
         | supported Francois Holland (Socialist Party - PS) and was an 
         | alliance of the Socialist Party (PS), the Radical Party of the 
         | Left (PRG), the Citizen and Republican Movement (MRC), Ecology
         | Generation (GE), and Citizenship, Action, Participation for the
         | 21st Century (CAP21). ALLIANCE 2 (no official name) supported
         | Nicolas Sarkozy (Union for a Popular Movement - UMP) and was an
         | alliance of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), the 
         | Radicals, New Center (NC), Christian Democrat Party (PCD) and

         | PARTY A (Harmony, SDPS) is a party that represents the interests 
         | of Russians in Latvia on a social-democratic platform. It was 
         | founded in 2010 after the amalgamation of three parties: the 
         | National Harmony Party, New Centre, and the Social Democrats.  
         | In the 2011 elections, the party was part of an electoral
         | alliance with the Socialist Party. In 2014, the Socialist Party
         | did not contest the elections but its three outgoing members of
         | parliament were placed on the Harmony party list and therefore
         | it retains membership of the Seima (Latvian parliament). 
         |
         | PARTY 7 (Latvian Russian Union, LKS) changed its name prior
         | to the 2014 election. Before that, it was named the party
         | For Human Rights in United Latvia (PCTVL). 
         |   
         | PARTY 14 (Reformu Partija, RP) was known until 2012 as Zatlera
         | Reformu Partija (Zatler's Reform party). In 2014, it competed
         | within the same list as PARTY B (Unity, V).

         | In the 2012 Mexican election, the likeability of Presidential 
         | candidates for each party was measured, rather than the 
         | likeability of each party's leader. Only four parties stood 
         | candidates for the Presidency, hence no likeability measures
         | are available for the leaders of the PVEM, the PT, or the 
         | Citizen's Movement. 
         | 
         | Two alliances formed in the 2012 Mexican election. ALLIANCE 1,
         | Commitment for Mexico, was an alliance of the Institutional
         | Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the Ecological Green Party of 
         | Mexico. ALLIANCE 2, Progressive Movement, was an alliance of 
         | the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), the Labor Party 
         | (PT) and the Citizens' Movement (MC).

         | LEADERS A-F were the Presidential candidates of their
         | respective parties/alliances in the 2014 Romanian 
         | Presidential Election.
         |
         | The alphabetical codes were assigned in descending order of 
         | the party vote share, i.e., the vote share in the 2014 
         | Romanian Presidential Election that a specific candidate
         | gained for their party. Among the top five vote receiving 
         | candidates, however, there were two non-party candidates, 
         | namely Calin-Constantin-Anton Popescu-Tariceanu (LEADER H)
         | and Monica-Luisa Macovei (LEADER I). These candidates were 
         | assigned alphabetical codes because of their results and
         | because there is relational data, such as the LIKE-
         | DISLIKE  LEADER rating, available for them in the CSES data. 
         | Because these two candidates were non-party candidates, there is
         | no data available for D3011_H (LIKE-DISLIKE  PARTY H), D3011_I
         | (LIKE-DISLIKE  PARTY I), D3013_H (LEFT-RIGHT  PARTY H), and
         | D3013_I (LEFT-RIGHT - PARTY I). The remainder of the non-party 
         | candidates, both for the current 2014 Romanian Presidential
         | Election and the previous 2009 Romanian Presidential 
         | Election, were recoded into category 89. INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE
         | (NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED). The number of respondents who 
         | mentioned to have voted for such candidates was N=5 for the
         | current vote choice variable (D3006_PR_1) and N=12 for the
         | previous vote choice variable (D3008_PR_1).
         |
         | PARTY A (PSD-UNPR-PC Electoral Alliance) was an electoral
         | alliance made up of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the
         | National Union for Romanias Progress (UNPR), and the 
         | Conservative Party (PC). 
         |
         | PARTY B (Christian-Liberal Alliance, ACL) was an electoral
         | alliance made up of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the
         | Liberal Democratic Party (PDL). 
         | 
         | Party 17 (Social Democratic Party & Conservative Party 
         | Political Alliance, PSD/PC) was an electoral alliance made up
         | of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Conservative
         | Party (PC). The alliance was formed for the previous Romanian
         | Presidential Election which took place in 2009.

))) PARTY IDENTIFIERS FROM OTHER COMPARATIVE STUDIES 
===========================================================================
For all parties that are assigned an alphabetical code in the CSES dataset,
CSES provides party identifiers from two other comparative projects, 
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, 
formerly the Comparative Manifesto Project, CMP) project, and The 
Parliament and Government (ParlGov) database. Below, we list the 
identifiers assigned by each project to a party included in CSES Module 4.
Inclusion of these identifiers allow for easy data bridging between
CSES Module 4 and these datasets. 

Data only listed for polities where information is available. Polities are 
listed in alphabetical order. Parties are listed in order of their A-I 
assignment in each polity. In circumstances where there are multiple 
elections that are included in Module 4 for one polity, parties are first 
listed according to alphabetical assignment for the first election 
study in question.
